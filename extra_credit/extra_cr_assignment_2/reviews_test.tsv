This was our first time visiting the city of New Orleans. The Omni was the PERFECT hotel. It is in the middle of the French Quarter, but not on crazy Bourbon Street. (You NEVER want to stay on Bourbon Street!!) The hotel was clean and elegant. Our room overlooked Royal Street, which is a beautiful street lined with art galleries,... More	5.0

Great new hotel with amazing access to shopping and some nightlife - not to mention day time beach trips! If you get a higher floor you can see the entire boardwalk and down the coast in both directions. Pretty funny to watch the great HB police case off the night time beach goers!	5.0
Great location in Crystal City - near the Airport and Metro. No car necessary to see DC. Hotel is comfortable for families and quite affordable compared to others, especially if you need more than one room with kids. Breakfast buffet is convenient and nightly reception is nice as well. The pool is small but adequate. Staff was very friendly and accommodating.	4.0
I had a late flight in so I was tired when I arrived. The staff was polite and tried hard to be accomodating however to start with the remote wold not work, so I was told to come down and get battery, this didn't work so they finally got another. The room was dirty, the sink leaked all over everytime you ran water and when trying to shower in the morning the water was only lukewarm!!	1.0
Stayed here for a WCU graduation. Rates were high, room was so so. Breakfast was bland and sparse. Bathroom was dirty, doors were beaten up and everything was tired and outdated. Not a definite no, but for the price I was very disappointed. Better places to stay for far less money.	3.0
We wanted to take an opportunity of the perfect riding weather and decided to book rooms here. We rode from Dillard through Highlands to Cashiers. What a beautiful ride!

The criteria for me to give 5 stars are: pleasant Front Desk, clean rooms, soft bed, quiet and good water pressure with an adequate free breakfast.

We stayed at this hotel because it was in Boone (Iowa) and we had a visitation there and a funeral the next morning. It was clean, but we did have some issues. The smaller coffee pot (5 cup) was nice to have in the room, but it didn't work correctly. The bathroom was clean, but the tub had a really slow drain. There was a clock radio in the room, but it wasn't set to the correct time (a personal pet peeve) so I had to set it - and it was really difficult to figure out and then it was bolted down to the table with only about 3/4 leeway on the cord, so we also couldn't move it out a little bit to be able to see the time if either of us woke up during the night (again, a personal issue). However, the breakfast in the morning was really well stocked...basic continental breakfast foods with 2 waffle makers...so not very varied, but was good. Staff was in and out making certain that there was enough food out and cleaning off tables that had been used. If you need to stay in Boone, it would be alright - as long as that is all that you are expecting. Otherwise, I would suggest staying in Ames and driving over since it isn't all that far away.	2.0
Located directly next to the Space Needle and with all kinds of food options nearby, the Maxwell served as an excellent base for discovering Seatlle. Our room was very spacious, modern and clean and the free parking made for a pleasant surprise. Although breakfast isn't complimentary we can recommend the coffee and freshly toasted bagels from the espresso bar.	5.0

Your standard Holiday Inn hotel. Wish the chain would remove some of the gimmicks and drop the price, but I get some people enjoy them. It was a pleasant stay, the workers at the desk were very helpful on telling how to get around town on the public transit system and were very kind. Breakfast is solid and there's plenty of room to eat. If we go back to Oregon, we'd consider staying here. Wish the Max went a little farther south closer to it, but that's not the hotel's fault.	5.0
Came to life in color and they charged me 50 because we got a little paint on the shower curtain on towels. No where else. If there is going to be an event like that within 2 miles of your hotel and you put a special price on your hotel that weekend, you have to expect people who attend the event will go to your hotel. 50 is extravagant for a little paint. Also, no parking garage Or else we couldn't find one and got charged another 50 for a garage down the street for ONE NIGHT.	4.0
Stayed for two nights in a corner room which was light and airy, very well designed in a clean modern style. Beds very comfortable, great blinds on the Windows, no fussy furniture! Bathroom worked well, nice big vanity unit and a hairdryer that plugged in easily next to the huge mirror, for anyone who likes to dry their hair you'll know what I'm talking about! Sliding mirrored door to shower/toilet all gave the feeling of space. The only slight niggle was the a/c which was a bit noisy, not enough to bother us though. Easy walk to many places, shops and attractions. Will definitely stay Aloft again!!Come on back anytime! It's good to know that you enjoyed your stay with us and glad you found the room and location to your liking. Thanks for taking the time to share.	4.0
I really like this hotel -- friendly, inviting staff upon arrival, vibrant lobby and bar, and large clean rooms.It is close to the airport and within walking distance of many fine dining opportunities.

This was a good last minute place to stay with a convenient location. Room was clean and quiet. Rate was reasonable and receptionist friendly. Easy access in and out of town before driving through Rocky Mountain park.	4.0
We made a last minute reservation because of location and price (which at 157 a night wasn't really a bargain) for this hotel. The location is great, you can walk to some shops and eateries. It is a short drive or bike ride to the beach which is nice. Our first room had a faulty air conditioner and the room was super musty. That being said, the hotel staff was GREAT and got us another room. They continued to be really helpful and friendly throughout the stay. The room was really tight for a 5 night stay and I'd only recommend this for 1 maybe 2 nights tops. The pool was clean and the free breakfast was so/so. Other than the staff, I probably wouldn't stay here again...	3.0
Only stayed here 2 nights, but I'd go back again in a minute! It's only 16 rooms, and they aren't huge, but beautifully decorated.

I was with four other people on a birding trip to watch the hawk migration. We spotted over 50 species of birds as we traveled across the keys. The hotel is new. The room was spacious and I loved the shower, microwave, and mini frig. The breakfast was wonderful and allowed us to make an early start for our birding. I commend Rosemary Johnson, an employee, that assisted me in finding ice, entering the pool area, and making me feel welcome even though it was late at night. Thank you for a lovely experience.Thank you for your comments. So glad you had a great stay. Rosemary is one of many of our amazing team members here to assist our guests. Thank you for staying with us. Hope you come back again to explore more of this wonderful bird sanctuary habitat.	5.0
Everything was great, cabin and views are amazing. Fishing is second to none for trout. Master bedroom is great but the bed is not, had to move to the couch where i slept like a baby. With a new bed this would be 5 stars. Also, the owners were great!	4.0
Before coming to Tahoe and reading the reviews for this hotel, I was skeptical to give this place a try. The reviews said the place was very old and needing of remodeling.

After being on a 7 day cruise that left out of New Orleans, we decided to stay and explore the beautiful city of New Orleans. We were with a group of friends who were staying at the NOPSI Hotel, so we decided to book a room there too, and boy were we glad we did. This hotel is virtually brand new, opening in July 2017. The NOPSI Hotel building formerly served as the headquarters of the citys power and transportation company, New Orleans Public Service Inc. Its absolutely amazing how this hotel has been transformed into such a gorgeous and luxurious hotel. As we pulled up to the hotel, we were warmly greeted by the bellmen, Bolton and Will. These gentlemen took great care of us and our belongings. What a great feeling to be welcomed so warmly the minute one arrives at a hotel! The rooms have the most comfortable mattresses, finest linens and all the amenities you could ever want, including robes. They bathroom is quite exquisite, with its grand two door entrance, marble countertops, double sink, and oversized shower.If so inclined, you can choose to indulge in an on sight spa service at the NOPSI Spa. There is an on sight restaurant, multiple bars, one in the grand atrium and one in the restaurant area. Be sure to check out Above the Grid, the rooftop pool and bar. Above the Grid is open to hotel guests and locals, providing everyone with an extraordinary view of the citys skyline. NOPSI Hotel is about a 1 mile from Bourbon Street. Its situated in a perfect location, walking distance from virtually all local attractions. We walked back and forth to Bourbon Street many times during our short stay. On sight parking is available for a fee. You should contact the hotel directly for daily rate charges. Pinot, Thank you for sharing your NOPSI Hotel experience. We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay. It has been exciting for us to finally share NOPSI with our guests. Whether you are dining at one our restaurants or relaxing in one of our well-appointed rooms, we are here to make your stay memorable. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager	5.0

The room was clean but the refrigerator was very loud so loud that it woke us up. When I contacted the staff, they came to the room but since I had out , so left a note to get contact them.

92.50 for the smallest, dirtiest, hideous,smoke smelling room I've ever stayed in. Management is white trash and extremely rude to customers. There is no reason to ever stay in this hotel, it's garbage and should not be open to the public.	1.0
While not directly on the river walk, this hotel provides a driver named Joe that really enjoys his job of driving people to the river walk and other downtown locations.

I've been a longtime fan of old, restored railroads, so I was thrilled when I first learned of the Caboose Motel years ago.

Bad: I think there could be more options offered as breakfast (there were only bagels and donut like something, and fruits), but it was still enough. So it's not something I didn't like but something that can be improved. Good: This hotel was a great one! When we entered room, there was classical music coming from the stereos, which give us a very nice feeling to start with. The bathroom, the towels, the bed, everything was clean, organized. I wish I could stick around more and enjoy the room as I stayed for 2 nights and was in the hotel to sleep only. The room was also facing the Boston public library, which was a blissful view, that makes you feel like you're in full luxury. The surrounding area was great, the parallel street (I believe it was Newburry) is full of nice clothing boutiques. It's really close to variety of food options and also right next to Copley station which makes public transportation a total ease. But I think when the weather permits, it's totally walkable to go around Freedom Trail etc. Also, I arrived very early in the morning and left in the middle of night, both felt okay to be out in the street, which is something I value the most.	5.0
I was pleasently surprised with the quality of the room and it's location. It was quite literally 3 minutes drive time from the Washington Monument and 10 minutes walk time from the metro. The staff was very helpful and the room large. It had a mini kitchen complete with stove, fridge microwave and sink. If I needed an inexpensive place to stay in DC for the week and didn't want to have to eat out every night this would be the place. It's age was showing, carpet stains, peeling wallpaper etc, but the staff was excellent and the rooms very comfortable. No one's home is perfect and this hotel isn't either, but if you are looking for a nice place to stay and can handle it not being absolutely perfect you'll be very happy with Virginian Suites.	4.0
Everything was great. Breakfast was particularly yummy with made to order omelettes. Only room for improvement is to increase number of luggage carts available in the lobby.	5.0

This hotel is perfect for going to do all the fun things in Seattle at Seattle Center. You can walk to everything and there are many restaurants in the immediate area.Love everything about the hotel great service took care of all of our needs, the only thing that I would ask is that if they do have room to grant your request for late out. They have a policy absolutely no late checkouts which is OK. Not a dealbreaker.Debbie F,It was a pleasure to have you as our guest recently at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown and it is exciting to hear that you found the staff to be helpful and inviting.

I was concerned about the location, because of the reviews, but it is a nice area. Far, of course, from the points of interest, but if you want to stay right next to rhe White House you have to pay the price. Very eficient staff, very clean room. I just hated the restaurant. The waitress was very slow, the food was not so bad, but when it finally got to our table it was already cold. I would rather go to McDonald's.	5.0
My stay here was pretty cool for the 1st time. This was my 1st time getting a hotel by myself and the experience was cool and relaxing. At 1st I was hesitant about getting a hotel here because of the rating but good thing I decided to check it out for myself. The only few thing was that the bathroom fan is loud and the actual unit only blew out cold air. But other than that it was very relaxing.	4.0

Dear Sir/Madam I arrived closer to 23h00 the first night. I was first assigned Room 421 which after spending some time there realised that the main lights were not working and the toilet appeared to be clogged - also found a sweetener paper wrap in the toilet. I was then assigned Room 418 - none of the lights in main area and then finally got Room 426 well past midnight. The lights kept having to be reset during the course of my stay. The general cleanliness of the rooms was not great.	2.0

Recently, enjoyed with my family and grandchildren 3 nights at this quaint beautiful centrally located hotel. Our room was beautiful and although facing the front of the property, we had a beautiful view of the mountains. The flower boxes were so beautiful hanging on the small patio opening of our room. Hummingbirds flew on the window boxes taking nectar from the petals. It was very wonderful to see. The rooms are large and all accommodations were much like a 5+ hotel. Beautifully decorated we were very pleased with our rooms. We especially enjoyed the valet parking and Eric who was so helpful. The check in process was easy and accommodated our early check-in wishes. The European style breakfast was enjoyable with plenty of food to fill you up for a early day of shopping sight seeing and photo opportunity. Walk literally out the door and you are welcomed by the abundance of shopping and restaurants. We will most certainly book this hotel again.	5.0
The hotel was awesome. We even got to see the Bones, Thugs and Harmony entourage. :P The only downside is that the pool was a little gross and murky. My son didn't care but I wouldn't step foot in there. It was tough to see the bottom. Unfortunately part of my search criteria for a Baltimore hotel was if it had a pool.	4.0

We have always been extremely satisfied with the Holiday Inn Express hotels that we have stayed in in the past, especially the breakfast buffets, and that was why we again chose a Holiday Inn Express when we were passing through the Baltimore area. Were we ever wrong on this one!! The buffet was very limited, hardly any hot items and what was supposed to be hot was actually stone cold (i.e. the gravy for the biscuits). The biscuits were rock hard. The scrambled eggs were a very bad version of imitation. Seemed like the person running the buffet was using week old biscuits and figured the warming lamps would heat up the gravy so she did not have to. I have never had a worse breakfast anywhere. If you are planning on getting your fill at this buffet - forget it. We had to go out to breakfast after checking out just to keep from starving. We hadn't balked at the room fee because we assumed the buffet would be worth the extra money - Boy were we wrong!!	2.0

Filthy, outdated, noisy neighbours, but this was not the worst. We were nearly eaten by the bed bugs, more agressive than Denali bears. I would not reccomend this hole even to my worst enemy. Next day we needed medical help.	1.0
My wife and I live in Vancouver, BC, Canada. We regularly vacation in Las Vegas because of the climate. We discovered the Suncoast several years ago and stay there frequently.

I never write these kind of things but this time I thought it was warranted. My family and I just finished a stay at the Springhill Suites by Marriott on Pensacola Beach and it was great.

The restaurant has a nice vibe. Staff are friendly and competent. Wine list a bit too simple. Food was good. The hotel is just average. Carpet in our room sorely in need of a cleaning. Bed was comfy but a double when a queen is pretty standard today. Bathroom was very, very clean. All rooms are very small. Internet sketchy.	3.0

Very clean hotel, good breakfast, good value for your money. The only reason for not giving it 5 stars... the single bed rooms are small. I did not get a chance to use the pool, but pool room looked extremely clean as well.	4.0
Very nice hotel. Clean rooms, good free breakfast offered. We had a very nice stay. Good beds and friendly staff. Hotel looks like it is brand new. Close to several restaurants right next door. We felt safe in the hotel.	5.0

I would love to write a great reveiw to this Hotel, just like the majority of the other people here.However......I did not actually get to stay here. A booking was made by telephone for a 2 bed suite for New years Eve. We arrived ready to check in. Unfortunately the desk clerk was totally unhelpful. Our reservation was non existant. The clerk did not give a damn. We had travelled only a relatively short time (150 miles), but now were without accomodation on New Year. The clerk would not even help with finding an alternative. The reservation had been checked TWICE before arriving, The first time was 2 days prior, and then the night before arriving. The number we were given WAS confirmed both times on the phone, so we travelled to Anaheim without any worries. HOW WRONG WE WERE! The Reservation number that was confirmed twice has now upon arrival turned into a non existant number. There was no record of the whole transaction. After trying unsucsessfully to get any help whatsoever from the staff, we decided to give up and find an alternative. As can be expected the area was booked up, except for one place - a real roach motel. We chose to stay there (another bad choice) and had the worse night sleep ever . Thanks to Marriot the 2009 celebrations were ruined! What more can I say except - CHECK CHECK and double check, even after you receive a conformation number. Get it in writing!It looks like they had double booked and tried to fob us off . Hope this reveiw is helpful to everyone.	1.0

The usual comfort and relaxation I expect from the Residence Inn/Marriott chain. Spacious accommodations, clean beds, familiar conveniences. I love the kitchenette's when available.

Friends had told us that this resort was worth visiting, so we booked a five day visit in early March, 2016 and weren't disappointed.

Good location. Close to highway. Close to shopping and lots of nice restaurants on 58. Easy drive to zoo, Nauticus, USS Wisconsin, Botanical Gardens, Aquarium.

This hotel is not up to the Hampton standards. The hotel is clean, but very dated. The furniture, carpet, doors, and woodwork all need updating. The room was clean and the bed a good bed. I typically stay at Hilton properties and was disappointed.	3.0
This is a great, quiet little hotel. It was clean, had friendly staff, a great breakfast and was a perfect stop over for rest. We will definitely stay again. Not a lot of frills, but a nice clean bed to sleep in	4.0
We were in town for the Pearl Jam show and used trip advisor to find this hotel. For the money, was very nice. Clean, friendly service, everything was easy. Breakfast was solid, good location and easy getting in and out of downtown. Would definitely stay there again.	5.0

The stay was for business and the room booked through my office. It was prepaid through Expedia. The room was FILTHY!!! Stains, burn marks, bugs, and it smelled terribly of smoke (booked a non-smoking room). The bathroom was extremely dirty and there was no way I could shower in it. One light in the room worked, all others did not. I video taped it because I had never experienced anything like this. I immediately went back to the manager and expressed my concern. He would not give me a refund so I told him I would take it up with my office and their credit card company. There was no way I was going to stay there. I drove home 2 hours and had to drive back the next day for my business event. It was that bad and I refused to stay there.	1.0
The tube had mold in it. The breakfast was not at all what was told me me. I was unhappy with my stay.	3.0
Hyatt Places are consistently guest friendly, offer the amenities that appeal to both the pleasure and business traveler, and are our preferred hotel when traveling. We always find the breakfast handy and offering a variety of food options, and most of the hotels offer a small bar with adult beverages, perfect for a nightcap.	5.0
Bad: Could have initially had more room towels. Good: Villa Paradiso was minutes from the beach. The hotel also provided BEACH towels daily so you didn't have to worry about the hassle of towels. The room was fully equipped with a kitchen. Great for late night snacks or meal and keeping leftovers cold in the fridge. I felt very secured at the hotel. The outside gate had its on key so that was a bonus. Walgreens is right across the street, we may have visited it a dozen times. Will book again when I come to MIAMI.	5.0
Hotel pulito e comodo, secondo gli standard della catena di cui fa parte, camere ampie e con tutti i servizi. Colazione inclusa, non di eccelsa qualit, ma comunque comoda poich non ci sono bar o locali nelle vicinanze tranne qualche fast food. Puttosto fuori dal centro storico pertanto consigliabile solo a chi dispone di un'auto propria o a noleggio.	4.0
This is a very large convention hotel with great rooms, typical of Hyatt. The pool area is amazing, with a massive, 24hour pool winding around landscaping and rock formations. There is also a lake with a small beach, bikes, boats and volleyball. I liked the hotel but have a bitter taste for it after the 27 daily resort fee and... More	4.0
Came to stay on way home from Baltimore- testing for husband- and had to meet in moyock NC. So decided rather then drive to OBX and turn around and drive back we stayed in Newport News. The staff was very nice- the room quiet and comfortable- and the area good for eats and shopping.	5.0
Bad: Too pricy, very basic for what you pay for. Good: Nice staff, good continental breakfast included. Excellent location.	5.0
I've stayed in so many Chicago hotels I lost count. This location is excellent. The front desk staff was very helpful and hip. Room very modern, large and included a fridge and pull out comfy chair. Parking was only 36 per 24 hours here. Recalling that you are in a big city here and not some country estate, would night noise from the Loop be a surprise Would a panhandler on the sidewalk be a shock Of course not. If these things are disturbing to you, don't stay here. If you crave peace and quiet, four star ambiance and price, you should go up to the Peninsula. The Italian restaurant in the building is very charming and did I mention the building is an architectural masterpiece by Herbert Hugh Riddle, 1928 Its a gem.	3.0
Good value for a clean, quiet, comfortable room. Easy to get to just off of I35 and 1 1/2 miles form I90. Good free continental breakfast and Kim, who takes care of the breakfast area does a great job of keeping the area clean and well stocked.	5.0
The first strike was a long wait to check in followed by average accomodations. Normal flickering bathroom lighting with marginal breakfast fare. All choice properties tend to be somewhat the same with the difference being the wifi here didn't work on this trip	3.0
Nice and close to everything. The staff are very nice, helpful and friendly. We had a room that looked out to the ocean at a distance. Nice heated pool.

I have been coming to the DC area on business for the past 6 months and will continue to do so for another 6 months. I usually stay at the Homewood Suites in Springfield, however, they were completely booked for this last stay. This is the first ... and last ... time I will stay at Extended Stay America in Springfield. The hotel literally STINKS!! The lobby, the elevator and our room had various smells of smoke, body odor, curry and feet!! Daily housekeeping service is only available if you stay for a week ... unless you want to pay 15/day for it. The towels are hard, scratchy and very thin ... and the toilet paper is the same. In our full kitchen, we had 1 fork and 3 spoons. The coffee maker was on it's last leg ... and we only had 1 packet of coffee with ancient creamer whose powder was so hard it didn't even melt in the coffee. The continental breakfast was 3 thermos of coffee, a basket of apples, and stale muffins and is located on a table right next to the front door, which caused a traffic jam with people trying to get in/out of the hotel in the morning. On a positive note, the hotel staff was pleasant, the bed was nice and the location is good. Otherwise, this hotel is definitely not worth the money!!	1.0
Bad: Phone in the room didn't work, and the valet was very slow. Good: Great location close to lots of places! Friendly staff!	5.0
It was awful We went for one night as we were grieving and needed to get away First of all the 35 parking fee was ridiculous and your parking attendant sneered at us and said This IS La Jolla. Wow. When I asked the front desk what was the deal with the parking it was just uh yeah sorry. The room 808 was just OK. Altjough we were kept awake by some shenanigans going on in The room above us ALL NIGHT We will not be returning and regret we booked this room in our grief. It did nothing to help.	1.0
This is a great hotel. The hotel staff is extremely friendly and courteous. Checking in and checking out was very simple without any wait time. The hotel room was spotless along with the lobby and other facilities. I highly recommend staying here.	5.0
Breakfast not as good as last time - air conditioner blowing on us while sleeping. Location, breakfast menu, comfortable bed	4.0
Barely a 4-star. Bathroom looked like something out of a Holiday Inn. The actual room itself had a very conveniently mounted TV so high marks for that, but beyond that there was nothing indicative of the price point. The sheets, pillows, and bed were mediocre at best. Also the room had the same, if not cheaper, in-room AC unit as a Townplace Inn I stayed at as well. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, but that doesn't justify the price. Also, they provided 0 benefits as a Expedia VIP member. Definitely would not stay here again. I'd either price down and stay somewhere else, or go a little bit higher to a 5-star.	3.0
I've stayed here several times and am always pleased with my stay.	5.0
The hotel offered many amenities that were beneficial to us for the reason for our stay such as, comfortable rooms and breakfast. Upon arrival a round trip service from the hotel to stadium was being offered for 20 dollars a person. We immediately jumped on the deal due to being unfamiliar with the area, as well as my wife expecting our first baby. She is restricted to the amount of walking she is to do and we didn't want to walk to and from the metro station in the dark. Our driver never picked us up at the drop off location, when speaking to him he misled us to where we were to go to meet him, he hung up on us and a police officer, and shut off his phone. We didn't get picked up until an hour and half after the game by the boss of the company. The whole ordeal was very frustrating and unorganized. We did get half of our money back from the second driver/boss of the company. When returning to the hotel the staff didn't seem concerned with the mishap. I don't think the hotel hired a credible company to provide shuttle services to their guests. Any guest should be cautious about using an outside shuttle service provided by this hotel.	4.0

This hotel is in the perfect location! A half block from Broadway Times Square in the Theater District. The lobby is nothing special, as is the streetfront of the hotel. Our room was clean and very nice. We had a King Deluxe. The bed was ok, not bad, but not exceptional. The toiletries in the bathroom were great! I usually don't use them, but I loved them all. The continental breakfast offered a nice array of options, and was well stocked. The coffee was very good. The free wi-fi was a nice bonus.We had a bit of a problem checking in. We arrived at about 11:30am. I had been told the day before, that it was possible that our room could be ready by 10:30 am, although check in was officially at 4pm. Our room was not ready, so we left our bags, with a promise that we'd be texted as soon as our room was ready. We checked back at about 3pm, even tho we had not been texted. Still not ready, they'd text. We came back about seven, still no text, and were finally able to check in. As we checked in, I heard someone asking about a wine and cheese hour. We had missed it! I remarked to my husband, that I would have loved a glass of wine after such a hectic day. The male who checked us in heard me, and asked what kind of wine we liked, and said that he would send some up, on the house! Within minutes, two bottles of wine, on ice and 2 glasses arrived. To be able to relax in our room, with a glass of wine, really made up for our late check in! The whole staff was very nice and I would definitely stay there again.	5.0
Bad: Heating Systems make noise. Breakfast was OKish. Good: Well placed for visiting downtown museums etc.	4.0
The main lobby and dining areas were clean. The room was musty and damp. The floor on one side of the bed was damp and sticky. Breakfast was alright - no healthy options, but it was fine.	3.0

Le St.-Rgis est incroyable. What a gorgeous hotel and what an upscale experience you will live by staying there. It was a dream come true. And if it wasn't enough, I bumped into Kate Mara in the elevator. I tried to act cool but totally failed. The rooms are perfect. The staff is perfect. Every square inch is clean and every detail was taken care of. I was lucky enough to have dinner in La Salle de Bal. It was fantastic.

This was the only hotel with a 2 bedroom unit available for our stay with a mother in law. I dont know about the regular rooms but this one is a separate building with 4 suites, each one of them with a living / kitchen / half bath downstairs and 2 rooms and a full bath upstairs. Few details: kitchen was not stocked: no glasses, dishes, forks, knives, pans...so you cant cook. We were not planning to cook but a heads up. There was unfinished drywall work on ceiling, very old inefficient windows and uninsulated roof. Good heat source but very noisy, cant keep it on at night it will wake you up. The room has not been upgraded since the 80s: green carpet, wall paper...just that old beachy CA feel. Service was excellent, so was their restaurant, but we felt that for the price and location this suite needs to be revamped. Worked for 1 night though.	4.0
Hotel staff were very pleasant and helpful! Room was clean and spacious. I found the bed to be very comfortable, hubby thought otherwise. Breakfast was very simple.

Nice hotel for families. We booked a 1 bedroom suite with 2 queen beds room. Lots of space and very clean. However, these rooms unfortunately do not have a very good view - they look into other rooms and courtyard. I think the studios have good views of the Space Needle. The breakfast buffet is great. Location is great - right across from Space Needle. We walked to Pike Place Market - a long but very doable walk.SFCALUSA,We are sincerely appreciative of your complimentary remarks on your experience at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown.

Although the hotel is in a convenient location and was inexpensive, the housekeeping is not acceptable. Sheets were not changed. Towels were not replaced. Sink was not clean.

It was a good hotel to spend for only one night there. The Wi-Fi didn't reach very well upstairs. Although, I overheard the staff indicate they were working on it. The hot water for the shower wasn't that hot or didn't have the potential to get that hot which could be good in a sense. I filled up an ice bucket and left it out overnight. The next morning, I discovered a dead cockroach. I don't know if that was a fluke, but that kind of shocked me a bit. I don't think bugs in general are very good. The area was quiet which was important to get some good sleep. The free breakfast was really good, the staff was super friendly, and the shuttle got me to the BWI airport fast. Overall, I think it's a good place, but needs a few things fixed. I recommend on the contingency those issues are fixed.	3.0

Bad: There was not a dinette set in the room so that my husband and I could eat comfortably. The room was much smaller than I thought it was and there was no safe to put valuables in when we went out. I was not comfortable leaving any thing of value in my room. There was no outdoor pool as stated by you and there was no jacuzzi. Breakfast food was cold and not tasty at all. I don't feel like I got my money's worth from this resort and I will not be staying at Spring Hill Suites ever again. Good: I liked the king size bed.	3.0

I originally booked a queen room but was surprised to see there were two double beds was no issue at all given the extra bed was good for space and to add I wasn't expecting a kitchenette in the room.

Front desk staff very cool and even with us waking up late and checking out a half hour after the set time there was no issue at all no one bothers about it given we did check in late.

Stayed at two different hotels in seattle. The maxwell is a gret location for the space needle, seattle center, science center, sculpture garden, etc. another huge benefit was the free parking- which is rare in seattle. The room came with many nice complimentary ammenities- kuerig coffee, popcorn, tea, shuttle rides, etc. For the price- this place was unbeatable.	5.0
This motel is clean, quiet, has A/C, flatscreen TV/cable, and well lit parking. It also has free wi-fi... Which I am using right now. Best of all, for a non-special Sunday night, we paid 58 for 2 adults, 2 children. Decor Style Who cares.... The bed and room are comfortable.	5.0
Hotel was very cozy . Staff was very friendly and helpful. Room was small but very pleasant and comfortable Stairs to get up to the lobby were steep . But definitely would recommend this hotel to my friends and would come back for another stay .	5.0
Was in town for a convention, and stayed at the Crowne Plaza Downtown. The hotel is very conveniently located adjacent to the Covention Center. Room was very nice and clean. Super water pressure in the shower, but, very slow drainage. The walls seemed to be very thin, as we could hear coughing in the room next to ours. 48 is... More	4.0
Nice hotel but poorly ran. During my stay I asked to extend one night my reservation, it was okey'd at the front desk, to my surprise the next morning when I got checked out.

First of all, I read these reviews alot and I am always suprised at how picky some people are. We are not that way and are usually looking for something that is a good deal even if it's not the greatest hotel. Having said that, this is my review. Got into the hotel at 11:30 at night after 11 hours of driving to find that the air conditioning in our room did not work. The front desk clerk was extremely rude and very difficult to work with, however a security/maintence guy was more than helpful and after about 45 minutes we were transfered to a new room. The hotel is extremely basic if that is what you are looking for. It is in the middle of roads and highways and overpasses and really has no character at all. If you are looking for a one or two night stay at a cheap price it's not too bad. The hotel does have a decent free breakfast, but if it gets to busy, it is very chaotic, crowded and dirty. There are several other hotels nearby that I would try first if we ever came to DC again.	2.0
Really nice hotel in an awesome area of Cali. Love this city, A LOT!!	5.0
We were lucky to be one the first guest at this brand new hotel in Napa , we were Very satisfied. The staff although new they tried to do their best. Now when I travel I always check if Hampton inn hotel is near by .	4.0
The hotel was clean and the staff were great!! The rooms were clean and the amenities were wonderful.

The facility was clean, the staff was friendly, and the breakfast was a perfect start to our day. Usually when they say free breakfast its just continental but there were eggs and sausage and waffles too. The picture of the room is exactly what you get. We even had little towel animals in the bathroom.	4.0
The facility was too old. But the front desk staff helped a lot.	3.0
Very nice hotel in the center of Midtown. The rooms are nice with great views. The doorman was very accommodating and the housekeeping staff went out of their way to help with our special requests. Will be back!	4.0

The hotel offers nice spacious rooms. If you have a room on a higher floor you will have great views around the city. The staff is very friendly and efficient. The internet works well and is fast.

My grandson was locked in the bathroom for 45 minutes due to faulty bathroom door locks. Hotel staff had no idea on how to get him out. My husband figured out what the problem was with the door and got him out. Now my grandson never wants to stay in any hotel ever again!!! Traumatic experience!!	2.0
Overall, the quality of my 3 day stay was good. The room and bathroom were clean, the bed was comfortable, the noise level was low, and the staff were polite and helpful. The workout room is adequate. The breakfast was descent and the hotel is conveniently located. Would stay there again!	5.0
I loved this quirky hotel and it's modern feel. Our room was very large and my husband and I appreciated the curtain that separated the king bed from the couch bed where our kids were sleeping. Breakfast was typical for a Hilton...they had the breakfast sandwiches that heat up in the special 1234 microwaves (dummy proof/kinda)...and it's all in the... More	5.0
Not happy because when I got there this was like the umpteenth time that I made a reservation through Hotels.com and not get what I reserved!!!. Makes me want to never use Hotels.com again. The room was run down, snags in the carpet, snags in the towels and sheets. And what made it worse was the side door stayed unlocked all night, drug activity in the parking lot, and there were no cameras in the stairwell from the side door....anybody could have come into the hotel and no one would see it. Very unpleasant stay and unsafe. Will not stay there ever again.	1.0
Room ok ( we had queen suite) bathroom very small. Restaurant poor. Staff friendly and tried to please.Hitel well suited for my needs as near the conference centre. Hotel shuttle bus fabulous ,drives 1 mile radius around the hotel, so very convenient and easy to get to shops and restaurants.Dear EvelynK,Thank you for taking time out of your to complete a TripAdvisor review regarding your recent stay at our hotel.

I bought a night at this location off of Trip Advisor and I got a really good rate for this area. The bed was awesome I had a really good night sleep. The view of the ocean was very tiny and I was told that if I wanted a better view I'd have to pay more even though there were... More	3.0
This hotel was perfect for a girls trip over labor day! For years we'd gone to Ocean City but this year we did not want to get overrun with labor day crowds and we happened to find Chincoteague. It was the perfect choice, even on labor day the traffic was minimal, it was quiet and the beach was not very crowded at all. The hotel is a short 10 minute drive from the beautiful beach so we could go any time. The room was very clean, updated, comfortable and spacious with a gorgeous view of the bay. Swimming in the outdoor pool overlooking the water makes you feel like you are on a tropical island. The staff is incredibly nice, helping us with directions and anything else we needed. It made a huge difference that we could pay a little extra and extend our checkout time to 7pm! We were able to have a whole extra day at the beach before having to pack up and go home, it was great! We are looking forward to our next vacation at the Comfort Suites!	5.0
This Drury is in a good location , right off 77, for a stop when driving south to Fla or Hilton Head. The staff is friendly, food is good. Breakfast has hot and cold selections, fruit and cereal.

One of my favorite hotels in SF and one of the best options you have down near SOMA. Its near the Moscone Center and Yerba Buena Gardens.

Had a king room--asked for one not facing the indoor pool.

We traveled to Tarpon Springs for two reasons: three business meetings and a dear friend's 75th birthday celebration. The hotel staff members were very nice and helpful. The hotel was lovely and clean, and our room was comfortable and accomodating. The free hot breakfast was an unexpected bonus! Quality Inn Tarpon Springs is certainly a budget-friendly, conveniently-located hotel, and it totally exceeded our expectations! We will definitely consider staying there for future business and personal trips to Tarpon.	5.0
I stayed at the Mark Twain last week for business and was impressed. The front desk was friendly and helpful. The drink and breakfast coupons were awesome. Breakfast was hot and delicious.

Good Hotel with reasonable rates. It was situated near highway 8. THe car noise was too much during the night and disturbed sleep. I will suggest other people to use this facility. Continental breakfast was fine in the AM	4.0
Parking is available at a parking garage a few streets away if you use the one recommended by the hotel. The rate the hotel give you is not the lowest rate you can get, I parked at the same parking lot for less using a parking app. It is worth looking into this if you are driving. Secondly, make sure you try and get a room with a queen bed. The doubles are tiny and this was my only regret with staying at this hotel. The location of the property is excellent. Easy to get to from the freeway, and easy to walk to Boston Common, restaurants, bars and local tourist attractions. Staff were very helpful on arrival and during the stay. No expense was spared in the room in terms of technology (had hard wired speakers even in the bathroom). Not sure they are needed, but was a nice touch. Rooms were clean, bathrooms small but had everything you need and was nice to have a shower not standing over a bath for once.	5.0
I have spent the last two birthdays at this hotel. It is the BOMB! Everything you want in a 5 star resort. I have so much fun. I visit the cafe for breakfast. I love the Vegas style bakery, with so many choices. The crepes are heavenly! The pool is beautiful and relaxing. They even have a suite-member only pool.... More	5.0
Bad: Room was very small and not comftorable for two people. It felt like a third the size of a standard hotel room with just enough space to walk around the bed and a chair in the corner. Bathroom is super small. View from our main floor window was a sketchy back alley with construction. Included breakfast is bagels, donuts and fruit, don't expect a warm meal.Our first night we asked the person at the front desk if there was any pubs or places close by to have a drink. He said he didn't think so... Well the next night we were out exploring the city and found half a dozen bars, restaurants and pubs a block away on the same street and discovered we were a block away from the famous Newbury street! All in all I feel like this hotel is over priced, unimpressive and uncomfortable. Good: The location of the Charlesmark is great for tourists and people wanting to be in a good spot to transit around but feel safe and enjoy some night life	3.0
Bad: Nothing..great staff.. Good: Great hotel beds...	4.0
We booked a night here completely last minute when we were at a Red Sox game. We got the pricing through Expedia and couldn't have been happier.

The google/website description is very misleading. It is NOT a BB and the term in-room continental breakfast is a joke.

We didn't stay at the hotel but went for breakfast twice because it was so good.

They have American classics plus Hawaiian traditional favorites. I... More	4.0

nice hotel overall. very clean with good appearance. pool was clean. we only stayed the 1 night. had 2 rooms. very comfortable 2 queen bed room with sofa. breakfast was good. basically the same variety as other hot buffet offerings. packaged muffins, waffle makers, eggs, ham, cereal. wanted a location close to the Globe Life field.	4.0
Staff was friendly and place was clean and very nice. Only issues that we had was the windows were a bit drafty, not sealing very well and most of the TV channels went out in the evening and didn't come back up until the time we left. I inquired several times at the front desk and they said they were working on it. I understand the weather was not good and may have affected it but not for as long as it was. Other than that, the stay was really really nice and comfortable.	4.0
We have stayed at quite a few top-rated bed and breakfasts before, so my expectations are high. We booked this one last-minute on the recommendation of a friend, without even really checking it out.

Hesitant to book after reading reviews but turned out good. Staff very nice. Room clean and spacious. Bed was comfortable with clean sheets. Don't know why people complained about the continental breakfast. They had cereal, waffles, muffins, good coffee, juice, etc. in a clean environment. The complainers need to realize this is not a bed breakfast or a gourmet restaurant. Had a first floor room and could hear upstairs foot falls but that is to be expected in any motel. Good thing no noisy people tho. Second night rate (Saturday) was way overpriced for this place. Would recommend if only staying a few days. This motel is just a plain vanilla.	3.0

Business require that we be in Norfolk early in the morning. Rather than fight the traffic from our home to Norfolk early in the morning we opted to stay in La Quinta. It was only 10 minutes from our appointment. The desk attendent was very helpful with direction. we arrived at our meeting rested and relaxed.

Bad: Can be a little noisy at night but that is the compromise for being at the centre of all the action. Good: If you are looking to be at the centre of all the South Beach madness then this is the perfect hotel. Located right across from the beautiful beach and in the middle of the Art Deco district. Large comfortable rooms that offer full amenities. Good rooftop pool with great snack and drinks bar. Staff very helpful and John the concierge was great.	5.0

This hotel is fine. The room was nice and the lobby clean. The buffet was good. My problem is you pay a premium for this hotel due to the location and it really isnt' worth the money., in my opinion. Stay at a hotel farther out and take the public transport system. Our one night stay for a basic room with a king bed was 345. Also, they give you ear plugs on your nightstand. Not a good sign. Bring a noise maker to drown out the noise.Dear TinasB3116Mo,Thank you very much for taking the time to review our hotel and share your stay with us. I very much appreciate the feedback and sorry to hear that you felt the cost did not match the experience of being at the heart of Seattle across the street from Space Needle. Our prices do very through out the year and often are much lower. Also if you are a World of Hyatt member and book directly with Hyatt.com you can save an additional 10 off.I hope you do keep us in mind the next time you are in the Seattle area. We would love to host you again! Most Sincerely,Jonathan	3.0

Great view from upper floor (we were on floor 34 I think). Bed was quite comfortable. Price was reasonable for a Kansas City hotel in the middle of everything. Fridge in the room which is great. No free WiFi which REALLY chaps me for as much as one pays for hotels now...but overall a nice stay.	5.0
We thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience in this recently opened dining room. The steak can only be described as succulent. The wait staff was professional and attentive.

There is really no other option to stay in Westport. We are in the process of moving, and are familiar with this property and have had no choice but to stay here when we are in town. While they state the place has been renovated, it is basically common area cosmetics. The rooms are VERY basic and each one we... More	3.0
The owners of this hotel are absolutely lovely! It's a wife and husband duo and you can tell they put a lot of sweat equity and heart and soul into running their lodge. The rooms were sufficient. We could tell that some updates had been made in recent years however, it was a hodgepodge of decorations. In the bathroom in... More	4.0
From the time I entered the hotel to the time I left it was a great experience. Had a wonderful room with lots of space and a great view to the city. The food was really good. And not to mention its Vegas, their casinos are open round the clock.	5.0
I booked this hotel for the night before a cruise. They had the best price for the hotels who include shuttles to and from the airport and cruise terminals.

The hotel is lovely looking from the outside, the grounds are beautiful but the rooms are dated, dark! We had a Jr. Suite with hopes of having a place we could relax in. The suite was not inviting.

This hotel is not up to my standards. The heating/cooling system was extremely loud and woke me up several times during the night. The hotel reception desk clerk was not helpful at all. The quality of food items for the breakfast buffet were very limited and not very good.	2.0
We stayed at the LaQuinta only one night, but will return at every opportunity. They're pet friendly which is wonderful. Now my baby can be our traveling companion. The room was great, clean and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and we were very pleased with our stay.	5.0
Overall the Viceroy was a really nice hotel. When I first arrived, I was disappointed that the hotel wasn't on the ocean, instead it was one block back. However, the staff made an initial impression when I entered. Very professional, courteous and attentive. The room itself was a little small, but very nicely decorated and immaculate. To me, the highlight... More	5.0

We stayed here for one night on our way back home from a vacation. It was a wonderful experience. We got the King Suite with a Jacuzzi in the corner of the room. Everything about the stay was super. It was close to restaurants for dining and they served breakfast early so we could get back on the road.	5.0
We have stayed at this motel many times while visiting family in Tennessee. I never even consider another motel. We have always been treated very well here. Everyone is considerate and friendly. The prices are just right and the location is convenient for us. I recommend it highly.	5.0

Shout out to the fantastic concierge staff. Luxury and class is the norm. Enjoy the complimentary Arnold Palmer in the afternoon by the guest elevators. And take a ride in the Bentley.

Very nice place, the room zone heating and cooling was either to hot or when OFF to cold with the outside temp at 30, the room cooled down pretty quick and got cold. This place is a very good value at 50 per night compared with what is in the area. YES, Id stay here again in a heart beat.	4.0

We spent the weekend after New Years at the Westin and enjoyed our stay. Rooms were decent sized, clean, comfortable and had great views.

Angenehmer Hotelaufenthalt mit ausreichendem Fruhstucksangebot. Hotel wurde uberwiegend nur zur Ubernachtung genutzt. Positiv das Zimmer war sauber und komfortabel eingerichtet. Negativ, man konnte das Fenster nicht offnen wodurch das Luften des Zimmers nur durch die Klimaluftung erfolgte. Ansonsten freundliches Service-Personal. Der Shuttleservice funktionierte ohne Probleme.	4.0
Beds were a little uncomfortable, but they made up for it with lots of pillows. Woke up with a crick in my neck each of the first two nights, but resolved it by taking the pillows from the other bed and creating my own pillow-top mattress. Problem solved.	4.0

The room was supposed to be a non smoking room yet the smell made it clear that previous patrons had smoked and more than just cigarettes. There was a cigarette burn on the wall above one of the beds. The overall condition of the room was disappointing especially when it cost 80.80 for a one night stay.	2.0

Our first impression of the hotel was a little sad. The front entry is very plain and not well lit. The lobby was clean and decorated nicely as was the room we stayed in. It smelled fresh and clean.

Bad: Extremely disappointed in Fremont Street. It used to be my favorite place to play/stay in Vegas but I will not be back. Very strange people just standing in the middle of the street. Cartoon characters, men in thongs and even one in an adult diaper! It's Hollywood Blvd on steroids! Thanks for the memories, Downtown Las Vegas. The Fremont Street Experience is one I do not wish to repeat!. Good: The hotel was very nice, much nicer than The Plaza next door.	4.0
This hotel is a terrific value. The staff,is always great, it's clean, and it's close to things. It's appliances are a little older, but they work perfectly! I always stay here when I'm in town.	5.0
This is a long-term stay hotel, so our room came with a kitchenette and small living room with a sofa and coffee table. We only stayed there for three nights, so didn't make use of the extra space, but it was nice to have room to move around. The reception desk was helpful and friendly. Breakfast was great, but skip the omelet bar. The line was too long, and it took forever. There were plenty of other options available (cereal, fruit, pastries, potatoes, eggs, oatmeal...). The complimentary shuttle was great for sightseeing. We took it to Pike Place and downtown saved on taxis and uber. Housekeeping could be more attentive, but since our stay was brief and we're not slobs, it was fine. Can't beat the location - literally across the street from the Space Needle and Chihuly.mistybunny,Thank you for staying with us next to the Space Needle! We love our incredible location and are ecstatic that you felt the same way. As one of the newest members to the Hyatt family, we are more than appreciative of your feedback and am glad to see you enjoyed your stay.

This is a pet friendly hotel. Having said that, it smells like a pet friendly hotel that does not get a thorough cleaning after a dog has been sick. We were booked into our first room which smelled like a mixture of beef jerky and vomit. Our second room was a little better, but we still had to go buy several candles to make the room habitable. The carpet was sticky, and the sheets were full of holes. The bathtub looked like someone took a blowtorch to a corner. The carpet in the halls is in a severe need of cleaning. Many spots and traffic patterns. The breakfast was good if you like lots of carbs. I came away feeling gross and dirty even after a shower.	2.0
This Hotel exceeded every need we had. We were expecting mediocre at best and everything was 5 Star. Room was exceedingly clean. Room was quiet. Breakfast was unbelievable. Check in and Check out were a breeze!	5.0
El hotel en general de muy buena calidad y a buen precio. Solo que un poco alejado del centro y lugares de interes, pero muy recomendable para caminar y conocer un poco mas de la ciudad.	4.0
Looks old from the outside but not bad on the inside. The breakfast and breakfast area was good. Baily's the restaurant was nice looking but understaffed at the time. The night shift lady messed up our room reservation but was quick to correct the mistake. The afternoon ladies were unpleasant and not quick to help. Not a bad stay if you don't need much help from the front desk.	4.0

I will stay at this hotel every time I travel to Oklahoma City. The staff are friendly and professional. The room was very nice and most important clean. The bed is made with wonderful soft sheets. I have nothing negative to say. This was my 2nd stay. 5 star stay without the 5 star price.	5.0
After visiting family and friends in Woodbury,TN we did as always, off to the mountains. For our needs, this Hampton was the most convenient which accepted pets, close to outlets and the most important, go karts. The outdoor pool was beautiful with a cozy fire pit. We will stay here again.	5.0
Bad: Only thing I would have changed is the climate control. It did not go anywhere near as high as I would like for it to go. Maybe it was just my room, but definitely could have been cooler. Good: Got more than what I expected from this hotel! They let me choose what floor I wanted to be on, which I've never gotten from anywhere else. Location is PRIME. Fremont Street is right outside their doors! The room is just like any other average hotel. It was very clean and comfortable. Michael Ovalles was very helpful in showing us around. He also helped us get our player cards and a complimentary deck of cards to enjoy our stay!	5.0
The temperature in the room was inconsistent. It was either to hot or to cold. The unit did not maintain the temperature I selected which was really uncomfortable at night while trying to sleep.

This hotel is the best we have stayed at in Baton Rouge -- Large rooms, very nice kitchen with granite and stainless appliances, clean bathroom with plenty of towels and toiletries, very comfortable bed with high quality bedding. The breakfast room was lovely with several choices for the hot breakfast, and the lobby was beautiful and inviting -- fireplace, comfortable leather furniture, fresh flower arrangements. Everything was nice, including the landscaping. We were impressed.	5.0
My daughter and I came to San Diego for a concert. I booked my stay but when I arrived to check-in, the hotel did not have a record of my reservation. I had my confirmation email in hand but the hotel clerk would only tell me she didn't have anything and said I needed to contact the Hotels.com. I think that I would have rated this hotel higher if perhaps she had offered to call them for my seeing as how I had my confirmation email in my hand and it would have just been that extra customer service effort. I did contact Hotels.com and they resent my reservation and the hotel upgraded me to suite for the inconvenience. There was no apology from the hotel which I thought would have been appropriate. My hotel key kept getting deactivated because my cell phone would get too close to it so that was a hassle, having to take it to the front desk to get activated. My room had a slight odor in it but after a day or so I didn't notice it. Overall my room was clean and it was quiet. It suited my needs but wasn't anything extraordinary or spectacular.	3.0
Price is good, service is good, cleanliness and comfort are average. Nice to have free breakfast even if it is simple fare.	4.0
We stayed here because it was close by to friends we were visiting. We were pleasantly surprised by the very comfortable room and bedding.

I stayed for 3 nights with my family. We enjoyed it. It is in a good location, actually not far from both crystal city and Pentogan city stations. However, we need to walk about 200 m to get to metro station of crystal city. This is a fine distance to walk. It is very quite and clean. Breakfast is excellent. The resturant also provide good grills. The stay is almost half or less than half price of Embassy suite in downtown, but it is only 15 min by metro from downtwon, and 1 stop by metro from the airport. It is an absolute great chioce to stay there.	5.0
The personnel at the front desk were very friendly and helpful. The room was a whole lot better than I was expecting. The bathroom was a bit tight, the shower/tub was a good size tho.	4.0
Mediocre. 2-12 hole in the carpet. Reading lamp missing from desk. Only one bulb in the lamp on the bedside stand, so the room was dark! Overall attention to details is lacking. The front desk staff are polite and helpful. The HVAC unit works well and is relatively quiet.	4.0

My wife booked this hotel for our conference. The room was nice and service was great if we requested anything they were quick to help. We didn't use the pool as it was usually raining when we would have used it. It would be nice to have a restaurant in the hotel although there are several places to eat nearby. The front lobby is kinda cool. Beds were comfortable and we had a good sleep.

We had two nights this month at the Envoy. Upon arrival we were not happy with front desk staff attitude, followed by getting a smoking room despite having booked non-smoking. On return to the desk they could only get us two doubles non-smoking although we were there 15 mins past 3pm and I am a Gold Elite BW member.Parking was good, secure and very handy.Later in the stay we experienced more rude front desk, and saw other guests experience it too.The remainder of hotel staff seemed friendly but spoke little English.Breakfast (included) was fine but they only would put out so much.... even though they had reserves and therefore one had to go very early if one wanted any choice.Location was fine - a block of the boardwalk - but nighttime ventures out showed the neighbourhood to be somewhat rough on the road to bettering maybeAC was ok which was good because it was hot!	3.0

For being located in the city of D. C. the price was reasonable. My biggest complaint was that I booked ahead of time through Expedia and paid using my credit card. When I arrived I noticed that they gave AAA members a discount and asked if I can get the discount being that I am a member. Of course, they said sorry but you already paid for the room and there is nothing we can do about it. Gotta love it when computers tie the hands of people from being able to do what's right. I should have been able to receive this discount but, the computers would not allow it. This is wrong. In the past before modern technology they would have done this. While all this was happening there was a gentlemen next to me that complained about a price variance due to not receiving a AAA discount and the staff did an over-ride for him because he did not pay yet. I'm not sure I can use services such as Expedia again if this is the result. I hate feeling ripped off and I definitely was in this case so no more Expedia for me unless I get my discount back.	4.0

We were visiting family in Portsmouth, so this location was convenient for us. The hotel is on a street off the highway and by itself, so it is a quiet location with field and woods views in the back. On our first morning, the breakfast buffet had no food left by 8:30AM, so we had to wait more than 30 minutes to get anything to eat. On our third day, when we arrived back from the beach around 3PM our key cards would not open our door. When we did get new cards, we found our room had not been cleaned and only one towel was left for all of us to shower. In spite of the glitches, we would use this hotel again.	3.0
our only complaint is that the hotel staff were not very knowledgeable about the area couldn't give us directions. Also, there is no food nearby or in the hotel.	4.0

This place is an average hotel. No casino, no room service, no glitz or glam. BUT it has clean rooms, clean pool w/free cabanas, a small nice restaurant, and nice staff. Location is next the Wynn and Encore close by Circus Circus. Across the street from a 24hr Walgreens and Dennys. I wouldnt call it a family place but its not bad for families. Some young and old partiers but not overly loud or obnoxious. If youre looking to go and dont need the pricey amenities then this place is right. It could use some updating but we werent in the room staring at the walls.	4.0

A smaller hotel with a European feel, if you don't mind the 7-8 blocks to Peach Tree center, this is an excellent value.

This hotel was Amazing! Though it's not as hip as the W Hotel, The location is amazing - right across the street from K-Pauls and Nola's - two great restaurants. Also, the pool is probably the best of any hotel pool and you really have to have the pool when it's around 90 degrees in the spring and summer. I highly recommend this hotel!	5.0
Seems like an older hotel but clean and comfortable with good service. The one thing that threw us off was that we were expecting the usual breakfast buffet but instead received vouchers for a specific breakfast or 5 off any menu item at Perkins next door. The kids got anything off the kids' menu for free. It was a good deal but disconcerting.	4.0

Clean, comfortable bed and modern dcor. A very nice rooftop bar but there are times this place gets too busy for the number of employees, so services gets a 7 (from 1-10) Good value on alcohol.The breakfast service is super good, the have a buffet style and fresh omelette's made to order. Must say this hotel does not really cater to the business traveler, no comfortable desk area in room, no place to make a few copies (i.e. business center) For a vacationer this is super great place, clean, location and good staff.Thank you for taking the time to share this review of your stay and for providing this feedback.

It's great to hear how much you enjoyed our breakfast service, location, and most aspects of our property. We appreciate having you as our guest and look forward to having you stay with us again should your travels bring you back to the area.Regards,	4.0
This is a one Star hotel . Dirty , smelly , in bad area . Definitely will not chose BW in future	1.0
Room was clean. Hotel located at a busy intersection. Windows were so outdated, every outside noise was heard. A lot of traffic noise. AC unit kept coming on snd off so frequently, it kept us awake. Initially when we arrived, no one was at the desk. Had to wait several minutes before being helped.	3.0
Having travelled over the past 6 months, this hotel for a 3 star location was very disappointing. First the decor is very old, dark, and non-inviting. Secondly, the Ramada is advertised in the Arundel Mills area, plenty of restaurants to choose from. However, on your way from the airport to the hotel, you realize that you are as far removed from as possible from anything nearby. They offer transportation to the Mall ( approx 4mi track) for 10.00. Obviously not customer-friendly. They infer that the transportation is to be free. Also, upon arrival in your room you discover there is no clock radio of any kind, there is no booklet to explain the amenities of the hotel or nearby attractions. When asking the front desk if if the booklet might have been taken, they sheepishly responded Wedon't have anything like that. The continental breakfast was ok noting that rarely was anyone from the staff keeping the items replenished or the juice containers from being completely out. After a 20 min return the orange juice was still out at 7:45 AM. Because of the lack of additional restaurant convenience I did eat at the hotel. The food was decent, but nothing to rave on and the cost was a little above average. Service at the restaurant was fair not because the servers weren't trying, tbut because there are only two servers period and one helps at the bar. Finally, there are no internet instructions posted in the room.	3.0
I purchased my room a week in advance. Had a low rate. I was really impressed for it being a lower rate hotel. My room was clean and cozy. Looked as though it was updated. Everything worked great. The bed was very comfortable. The free breakfast was accommodating. The staff professional and nice. I would stay here again!	5.0
Room was a bit small, well furnished, very clean. Very quiet. Would stay again. Right on the Interstate but is very quiet. Breakfast is minimal but the area is very clean. I believe the shower door is installed backward as you have to get in the shower to turn it on and risk cold shower before the water warms up.	4.0
The good First let's talk about the great things at this flagship hotel and there are so many! The location is in my opinion is as good as it gets in NYC! Two blocks from Saks, Museum of Modern Art and St Patrick's Cathedral, one block from Madison Ave, three blocks from Central Park and the city's best restaurants within easy walking distance. Everything is at your fingertips! The architecture of this iconic building is absolutely stunning and St Regis keeps it in tip top condition with gleaming marble flooring, 24 carat accents and sparkling crystal chandeliers, all as you would expect and more. The Christmas decor from the massive toy soldiers at the entrance to the golden leafed apple tree in the foyer were absolutely stunning! Hats off to the extraordinary designer!The rooms and suites are spacious and tastefully decorated with marble foyers, crystal chandeliers, deep crown moldings, luxurious fabrics and marble bathrooms with double sinks, TV in the mirror, deep soaker tub, separate shower and European-style private flush. The beds are as comfortable as any you will find at the finest hotels in the world. The full time butlers are efficient and friendly welcoming you upon arrival with tea and coffee and each morning as well. They look after your every need from shoe shine to pressing efficiently and pleasantly. Fresh fruit awaits you and is daily replenished. Wi-Fi is included, as is bottled water which is replenished twice daily with the maid service. The mini bar is well stocked and there is ample closet space with plenty of hangers. The rooms and entire hotel are spotlessly clean! All the staff are friendly from the doormen, waiters, maids, valets, etc. We opted out for the Platinum breakfast choice and it was a daily delight in Astor Court with a nice menu selection, well prepared and quickly served.The Bad Being an SPG member for 16 years with over 900 nights to date and Lifetime Platinum status we expected to be upgraded to a suite upon arrival which is the SPG policy. It is something we have always received at all SPG properties, 100 of the time since gaining Platinum status many, many years ago. We booked this trip six months in advance so it wasn't like they didn't know we were coming. We even processed our Suite Nights Awards certificates to further ensure the upgrade. We had saved those upgrades for this trip but since they expire Dec 31/15 they are useless to us now. Our first bad experience was upon arrival at the front desk where the clerk informed us that we would not be upgraded. It went from bad to worse as she told us that we were not entitled to the upgrade. She didn't seem to understand the Platinum perks. Talking with her was like talking to a wall, so unlike other 5-star hotels we've stayed which are usually so highly trained and informed. We were shown to our Grand Luxe guestroom which is a very lovely room as far as rooms go. I will say if you were ever not going to receive an upgrade these rooms are as lovely as it gets. Over the years I hate to think what my husband has spent at SPG hotel stays to have earned his Lifetime Platinum status which is not a gift which the desk clerk seem to indicate but very expensive to achieve. Not receiving the upgrade was such an insult to my husband who has stayed as many as 154 nights in one year alone with SPG. He was very upset and disappointed as we were really looking forward to this stay not having been to NYC on a Thanksgiving holiday since 1985 when we met and had our very first trip together! Of course when you don't get a suite you don't get the toiletries that go with it which I've always loved at the St Regis. I suppose I could have requested it but I didn't. We just settled into our room prepared to make the best of a nice holiday.The Ugly Staying at the hotel for a week, one of the expected highlights was Thanksgiving Dinner at Astor Court. We thought we'd stay in-house after long hours watching the Macy's Parade. Huge mistake! Upon arrival at Astor Court we were seated in the bar at a small round table with 2 tiny bar chairs! We couldn't believe it and should have left but where do you go at this late date The meal was worse then I can describe and actually included processed turkey! Not even real turkey. I couldn't understand why I was sent a form at home to sign prior to arrival so they could charge our credit card a week before the dinner. Now I know! No one in their right mind would pay 400 USD for that miserable meal for two people. I can't adequately describe our disappointment. We have always loved this hotel and enjoyed wonderful special occasions with delicious meals such as New Year's Eve but even the dinner time room service food was horrid. We couldn't even eat the salads. What kind of chef can't make a salad. Seems the breakfast chef was great and the evening chef was worse than lacking. Talking with the room manager was a waste of time upon check out we saw that she gave us a 200 credit on our account for having sat us in the bar for Thanksgiving Dinner! That just added insult to injury as during the conversation she called my husband by the wrong name no less than six times although we kept correcting her. I don't think I could ever get my husband to go back and truthfully I can't blame him. It's a shame that such a gorgeous establishment with so many great long time staff should suffer because of the lack of a decent chef in what should be a 5-star dining room! After visiting 6 other St Regis Hotels in the past with their exquisite chefs to experiencing this in their NYC hotel just doesn't even make sense!Dear Katherine B,Thank you for taking the time to submit your recent review on Trip Advisor. We understand that our leadership team has been in touch with you while you were on property and again after your stay. We truly hope to regain your trust and wish you all the best for the holiday season. Kindly,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager	3.0
Our stay was fantastic, our room had a wonderful view of downtown Atlanta! Everyone was very hospitable, room was clean and comfortable. A special thanks to Mr. Gary Thomas for making sure the our stay was fantastic until the minute we pulled away from the hotel parking.	5.0
Bad: The check-in process was not good. I felt that I had been singled out as a young black male for staying at this hotel. Later, I also saw a young black male in the same situation as myself. In addition, every 45 minutes from 7:30 am - 11:45, I had housekeeping knock on the door twice, and two people walked in while my girlfriend and I were naked. Horrible experience. I called the next day to speak with the manager, left voice mails, and still no response!. Good: The majority of the staff was great.	3.0
I spent five nights in the hotel with my husband and our two boys. We enjoyed the hotel in general, the breakfast was good and the staff were very friendly. Since we wanted to visit NewYork, the location was great just 10 minutes away!	4.0
Staff does a very nice job. The second location I have stayed at and both experiences have been great. Close to downtown Franklin, 20 minutes to downtown Nashville. Very quiet and comfortable. Our stay at their location in Findlay, Ohio was equal to this.	5.0
Have always enjoyed staying here (clean, quiet and good breakfast), but the last few times there has always been a maintenance issue. This time the stool did not work properly and did not have hot water in the morning. Couple of times have had to switch rooms because of leaking water problems. Was great but seems to keep having problems.	4.0
We waited for everything and it was never worth it. The resort section is nice for older kids, but not much there for my toddler. Very disappointed with everything: We did not get into our room until well over an hour past check in - and they have a late check in time! If you have trouble walking but do... More	1.0

I usually stay at the HI Express, but their rate was way too high for me this time. This hotel was just fine. Like other Comfort Inns, the room was clean, the bed was comfortable, TV had enough channels, and there was a decent breakfast. I will probably come back again.	4.0

We arrived early and we hadn't slept. Our room wasn't ready. They finally gave us a room just to sleep in until our room was ready. Thank You!!!! Staff was friendly. Pool was clean and had a nice view with a breeze. Will definitely be back!! I've stayed in many hotels in New Orleans. This one is my favorite.	5.0
It is rare that a property can fulfill all my travel fantasies...but the Honua Kai delivered even beyond my high expectations.

From the moment we arrived, the valet service was quick to welcome and assist us...they had a list of... More	5.0
There are not many places to stay in this area, so this place is a good place for the night. It certainly beats the lower-priced hotels/motels that are usually offered in remote areas. The room we stayed in was clean and comfortable. There was a buffet breakfast offered in the morning for only 8.75, but after eating it, I wished we would've held out for a Cracker Barrel or even Dunkin' Donuts.	3.0
Bad: No bathroom vent.	4.0
Just stayed for 1 night because a friend was coming in from out of town. Unable to check-in early, but got a call as soon as the room was ready. Room was very clean. Small, but nicely appointed and comfortable. Nice bathroom, aside from some trouble in turning on the cold water for the sink (handle was difficult to turn). It also took a long time for the shower to warm up. Free wifi is excellent in this hotel.	4.0
The hotel staff were very helpful and courteous. The room was clean and had plenty of room for our family of 4. Not immediately in the highly commercial area which we loved. The beach on the Chesapeake Bay wasn't extremely crowded which was a bonus. They have very nice hotel ammenities including an indoor outdoor pool, hot tub, semi private beach, water activities, kids camps, etc. We had the opportunity to hear a live band in the restaurant too. Food Lion right across the street and only a short drive to the more commercialized area. We loved it and would definitely stay there again.	5.0

The hotel was very very clean with up to date interior furnishings and bedding. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.

This is a very nice hotel in a great location in Santa Monica. The rooms are well equipped and very modern.

Bad: Timing seemed to be off. Had to wait a very long time for breakfast, longer than people who had come in after us. Had to wait a very long time for the valet to bring our car, seemed to be some kind of communication issue. They were nice about it, and so were we, but it seemed to be a theme, which was a bit of a disappointment. Good: Nicely appointed room, great location.	5.0
What a lovely old hotel with so much character. The rooms are small but the Lanai's are really big. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom clean with lots of hot water.

Second time at this nice and modern hotel. As soon as you walk in the room the drapes open up. Pretty cool. Room is comfy and plenty of room. Beds are also comfortable.

We were in the area for a Cody Jinks concert (he's wonderful is you've never heard of him) and the location was perfect. It is located downtown on Fannin, so also a good location for anyone that might be in Houston for one of the hospitals. Hotel was also very aesthetically pleasing so kudos to whoever is in charge of decor. Rooms were small but other than that I have no complaints. Good bang for your buck and customer service was wonderful!	4.0
The towels were soft, pillows somewhat firm but there was a musty smell in the room. The breakfast was ok, eggs and bacon sub par. Its good vale for money and conveniently located.	3.0
Pictures must've been old. I got what I paid for....somewhere to lay my head and shower late at night from long drive. Only good thing is they put us where it was quieter. Stairwell and walkways were not renovated and smelled like urine.	1.0
This is a nice hotel, well placed for the business district and a short walk from Market Square. Good Gym and swimming pool, very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are a good size and well appointed. Would benefit from adding a safe to the rooms, a bit unusual that his is not provided these days.	4.0
This hotel was great overall--clean, decent sized rooms, and good breakfast. However, the only problem was that I was told when I booked it that it had a free shuttle. We were counting on using this to get to and from ACL. There was no shuttle, so this added some extra cost and planning. I would stay here again.	4.0
Bad: Room decor a little outdated. Air conditioner too loud. Walls a little thin so neighbors can sometimes be heard. Good: Value relative to other hotels. Location was convenient for exploring the strip.	4.0
Bad: The bed wasn't that comfy, which was surprising given all of the other amazing details. Sheets were rough/stiff- not cozy. Could be easily fixed, though!. Good: This was by far one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had. Check-in and check-out was super fast, staff was phenomenal, and the room was very intuitively set-up with thoughtful details technology. It was clear that Virgin isn't just a typical hotel. The chamber set-up of the room allowed for privacy comfort, even in a relatively small space. Snacks mini-bar had 7-11 prices. Everything was super clean, well serviced and wonderful. In short: STAY HERE!	5.0
This was an excellent hotel to visit! The customer service was some of the best I've received, and I travel all year. I will be staying here every time I return to the Charlotte area. Despite the busy weekend, this hotel still felt like my home away from home.	5.0
Stayed here for 2 nights, ahead of a road trip. The standout aspect of this excellent hotel is the staff - from check-in, housekeeping, barrestaurant, doormen, parking - everyone was pleasant, helpful, professional.

The only good feature about the room was the price. Although clean for the most part it was listed as non-smoking but it was clear the room had been smoked in. Maintenance was very poor. The toilet tank cover was missing and the seat would not stay up. The coffee service in the room had not bee replaced in ages. There was a small balcony outside the room but there were holes in the ceiling covering it. Also, the building was not secured at night. Anyone could walk in. The building is old and really needs to be renovated.	3.0
Two families shared a two bedroom two bathroom condo and didn't feel crowded at all. Plenty of space in the living and dining area, with extra space on the balcony too.

The grounds for the hotel was ok....I feel they should advise you that part of the motel is across a 4 lane road...and the rooms can be a lot cleaner than they were.

This is a solid 3 star hotel, the rooms are old and smell like mildew. The air conditioning is loud and drips. If you get a room on the ocean they have good views and a good balcony. The staff was nice at check in. It's not great but not terrible. It's a typical Miami 3 star hotel.	3.0
Hotel room was filthy dirty. Room had heavy odor of mildew (and my allergies indicated mold was a real problem in the room.)

There were four people staying in the room. Only had 3 sets of towels. Told the front desk, they said housekeeping would bring another set. Never happened. Saw 1 person from housekeeping in the hall way. I asked for towels, she pointed to her cart down the hall and told me to get my own. Very rude. Also only 1 bench in front for you to be able to go have a cigarette. Could never sit and relax.	4.0

Was looking for a clean place to crash for the night , had a business meeting the next day. There was an old, tenament building smell in the building. You can tell they try to keep it clean. We met some hookers outside congregating in front of the entrance.	3.0
For a very quick trip to Disneyland we stayed at the Townplace Suites. The lobby and rooms are small but well organized and clean. The free breakfast was a hit but the small lobby can get crowded early in the morning as everyone heads out to Disneyland. Easy shuttle service from the hotel directly to Disneyland. There is a pool but we were too tired to take advantage of it! Good selection of family freindly restaurant and entertainment options right next to the hotel so all around a very good choice.Thank you so much for staying with us. I am glad that your family enjoyed your time here with us. Maybe next time you can take advantage of our pool area the next time your in the Anaheim area. We look forward to your next arrival.	4.0

The hotel may look a little run down at night, but after seeing it during the day it looks fine. I would probably suggest getting a cabin rather than hotel room.

My husband made these reservations and I was a bit nervous after reading some reviews. I was a bit more nervous when I saw their lobby which is far from the usual Marriott lobbies. However, our room was spotlessly clean, overlooked the lovely pool area and was quite nice. It was smaller perhaps but not nearly as small as I expected from some reviews and not small enough to be an issue. The staff was very accommodating and interesting. The location is centrally located and convenient. This is not a cookie cutter hotel. There is absolutely nothing cookie cutter about it. If you're looking for something unusual, this is it. Thank you for your kind review and for you loyalty to Marriott.We do appreciate the fact that you gave us the opportunity to surprise you in a positive manner. And we are delighted to hear that we have been able to meet and go beyond your expectations.As a boutique hotel from the Autograph Collection of Marriott, we are proud to differentiate ourselves by our unique concept and design.We hope to have the pleasure to welcome you again in the future.	5.0
Bad: 1st - PARKING LOT **BAD,BAD,BAD** This is 2017, nobody need driver to parking car, unless you're 85 yrs old (should not even drive). But drivers that steals quarters from your rental car, this is very low. 2nd - They asked a deposit of 100. Because I was planning to get it back, I used a BC and not a CC. On check out I was informed that it will take 1 to 2 days. Should I trust on it 3rd - If you sleep on that room 512 and need a AC on, make sure you are deaf or use to leave near NY freeway. The noise of that machine it's worst than sleep on LV international airport at 9am with your windows car open. Will I stay on this hotel again NEVER.

Overall this Best Western is nicely decorated. It was a bit disappointing that the bathroom did not function. A fairly busy property, so repairs were slow.

I am a member of the Gold Crown Club for Best Western and I have been very pleased with the hotels and the prices. Nice to have a Denny's on the property also. I would definately stay there again if ever in the area.We are glad we were able to check you in early. We apprieciate you being a Rewards Member! Membership has its perks. As you know early check ins, late check outs and even free room upgrades when available. We have also just started a full free hot breakfast in the newly remodeled Denny's on our property.

My sister I were worried about reviews of kids everywhere pool conditions and smells of a sewerage treatment facility nearby.

I was looking for a place to stay near the airport and park my car for the duration of our trip. Drury Inn was a great place to stay. I parked for free for a week. The bed was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept on!Thank you for your stay and kind words. We are happy you enjoyed our stay and fly package. We recently replaced our mattresses during our renovation and have enjoyed very good feedback. I need to try and get one for my house. Thank you for your business and we look forward to serving you in the future! Kind regards,Eric Gray	4.0

We only had two days to spend in Baltimore so I chose this hotel based on it's location. It was even better than I anticipated. Walking distance to Fell's Point. The room was spacious and well appointed. It was loud in the morning with breakfast in the lobby and housekeeping starts knocking at 8am sharp. They'll keep knocking too which was irritating so if you want to sleep past 8 put the privacy card on your door handle. Breakfast ends at 10 which I wasn't told at check-in and didn't see in writing anywhere so we missed that the first day. We were there for crabby hour and it was delicious and a nice touch to the stay! I saw other reviews complaining about parking, we didn't have an issue. There's a lot and a ramp right next door.	4.0
Well ran and very nicely maintained. Staff is friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. I enjoyed conversations with both the evening and day shift. Breakfast was well prepared and varied to suit different tastes. Location is good for walking to shops and driving up Oak Creek Canyon. Lots of little places to relax on the grounds. Beds were comfortable and the accessible... More	5.0

We chose this hotel because it is attached to the KFC Yum center and was told we could use the skywalk to and from the center (without, essentially, leaving the hotel). Unfortunately the skywalk was closed going IN to the venue, but we were able to use it after the event. We still think this is a grand idea, however,... More	3.0
Bad: Its not something i didn't like, its more like a recommendation since its not something quite important, and actually i don't know if other rooms have it but particularly my room didn't have a big mirror other than the one in the bathroom. Also, i think breakfast can be maybe until 11:30am, like other restaurants or hotel provide, more like a brunch style and serve more options. Good: Really modern hotel, very very clean room almost like if we were the first to use it, excellent staff. We arrived at 10am approximately since our flight was early in the morning and they managed to give us an available room. hotel is at an excellent location since its ocean drive but not at the crowded noisy part so we could party, and still be able to rest and sleep well!	5.0

The primary complaint was the inability to enjoy the pool and the beach, because work renovations were going on that left a steady snow like shower of Styrofoam sprinkles that blew over everything and coated the pool. It would seem that some type of netting could have been installed to have prevented this. Hotel patrons had to vacate both indoor and outdoor pools for staff to attempt to clean up the residue and of course there was no sunbathing to be had under the circumstances. So much for our ONE beach day.	3.0
HOTEL STAYThe company I work for is located in San Francisco. Last week I was sent down to the Anaheim office for 2 1/2 days from Wednesday to Friday. During my business trip last week I stayed at this hotel for two nights. Originally my boss tried to book my reservation at Ayres Hotel, which according to him was about 220 yards away from the office. However the second night was fully booked. The last minute my boss booked the other closest hotel, which is TownePlace Suites Anaheim. According to Google Maps the location of this hotel is about a 10 minute walk. I've walk from this hotel to the office. The walking time was a lot less then 10 minutes. I cannot compare this hotel to Ayres Hotel at the moment. However this hotel is not only close to the Anaheim office but also is situated with a lot of nice restaurants that are one block away. The room I stayed in was a studio suite, which included a kitchen. There was decent space inside the room unlike most hotel rooms as this room had a couch and kitchen. Twice at night around 9PM I swam at the swimming pool and sat in the whirlpool. The swimming pool was slightly heated while the whirlpool was really heated. Going to the swimming area helped me relax from that day's work. The one main knock I would say is the complimentary breakfast. The breakfast is buffet style with pastry, bread, coffee, eggs, and sausage. Both times I've had breakfast the eggs were overcooked and the sausage was cold. I don't mind if the complimentary breakfast was only pastry and coffee. However if there is hot, cooked food on the complimentary breakfast then items such as fried eggs and sausages shouldn't be stale. Overall I enjoyed my two nights at this hotel during my business trip.We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim. It wastruly a pleasure to serve you.We appreciate your business and value your honest feedback. Your comments have been shared withthe hotel team as a critical way of understanding how we can continue to deliver exceptional serviceto guests like you.Thank you for staying at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium and we hope you choose to create more memories withus whenever your travels bring you back to Anaheim.Sincerely,Edgar RiveraGeneral Manager edgar.riveramarriott.com	3.0
Great new and clean hotel. Staff is friendly and location is perfect. The only negative is the valet charge of 32/day. I thought that was excessive. I am not sure what the self park cost is since I arrived after midnight and just wanted to go to sleep once I got there.	5.0

If you are going to Napa, you must stay at the Hampton Inn Suites. The hotel is very clean, very friendly, and the rooms are updated. Many perks like cookies. tea, coffee in the lobby during the day, complimentary hot breakfast, and a snack bar to take with us to San Francisco. Definitely want to stay at the Hampton Inn Suites again.Dear 48mimiy,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa.

The hotel is a bit shabby and needs updating. Outdoor pool was decent, but the pool furniture was falling apart, and there was very little of it. On the sides of the pool, was a ton of trash, garbage, debris, and an old mattress propped up behind the dumpster. They really should see these things and clean it up. The room was like a small suite, with a new flat screen. The couch however was filthy. The couches in the rooms that I saw when doors were open, all need cleaned big time. Bed was OK, comfortable enough. I asked for an unstained comforter when I got there extra pillows, and my requests were pleasantly handled right away. I must say, the staff were all very nice. Maids forgot to replenish the coffee in the room, and I had to go for it 3 times. But they were always nice and brought anything we needed. It would never be my first choice in Beaufort, but not my last, either. They just need to pay attention to DEEPER cleaning and updating. Well-intentioned OK for a night or two.	3.0
My suite was definitely ample for one person. It was well-appointed and clean.

This hotel seems to be in the midst of a renovation. They said that they put me in one of their newly renovated rooms, so I would hate to see what the rooms looked like before. The textiles are new, but they should have invested in new mattresses and new AC units. The room felt damp and musty and I would have rather slept on the floor than on the deflated, old, lumpy mattress that they have on the bed. The rooms are extremely dark, even with every light on. I cannot believe that this is considered a 3 star hotel for Expedia. Definitely not! It feel like a motel.	3.0

The rooms are smallish but up-to-date. Very clean and sleek, two of us did not feel cramped. The hotel provides unlimited cold, filtered water and bottles for you to put the water in. They also have coffee, coffee maker, microwave and refrigerator. The views from the river view rooms are spectacular (we were on the 7th floor). Location is central. The staff is friendly and accomodating. The restaurant has a great mushroom with mozarella de bufalo and risotto appetizer. You really cannot ask for a better hotel!	5.0

Fabulous location. Conference facility, bowling, restaurant, pool, hot tub, and fitness facility all close together AND an incredible view of the Lake. Rooms were easy to get to.

The staff was super friendly. 5 stars for the young gentleman who checked us in. The physical property is seriously in need of repair. The breakfast area was fairly dirty - trash cans and cabinets covered in residue. Ramada needs to invest some in taking care of the property. Give the wonderful employees something to be proud of.	2.0
The reviews on this Best Western are all over the range of scores, but we all stayed at the same motel. Go figure! This is a basic services motel in an upscale county (Napa). Don't come here expecting frills and fancy decor. And what's wrong with eating breakfast at Dennys We used the coupons and our breakfast cost about 2 plus tip. If you are here to tour the wine country there are probably better places to stay. If you are just looking for a place in Napa to spend a night or two please give this place your consideration. We arrived here on our way to Sonoma County and needed a place to stay for 1 night. The Best Western suited our needs. Our room was clean and the furniture was in good shape. I can't speak to the ammenities since we just used the Best Western as a place to sleep, clean up and hit the road.	3.0

Stayed here to catch NYC at Christmas and were excited to stay in a legendary hotel. We have stayed at the St. Regis in Mexico City, Singapore and others, and were expecting the same level of excellence. We truly wanted to love this hotel, but instead, left feeling grateful we used points, and not cash, for our stay. Sad to say, we would not return. The good and the bad - The Good - Rooms are beautifully appointed, location can't be beat and some of the staff were outstanding. The Bad - Attention to detail has been lost. Some examples - long lines to check in and out. Yes, we realize it was high season, but staffing should be commensurate with the expected flow of guests. Next, after the bellhop delivered our bags, we asked for a bucket of ice. It never arrived and we had to get it ourselves. Breakfast took even longer than the ice. Small, but telling, details. Left feeling like the St. Regis NYC relies on its reputation to pull in the crowds, its service certainly doesn't warrant a pricey stay.

love them!! everyone is super nice. never have we had any issues with our booking or our room. good location. had a problem with our car and had to leave it there for a week and they were nice enough to let us keep it there while we figured out how to get it back home lol	5.0
Wanted a Hotel close to Joshua Tree NP and this one filled the bill being in Twnetynine Palms, Truthfully I picked based on the look of the pool.

My wife and I were celebrating our 23 year anniversary in the king jaquzi room , this is the most reasonable priced rooms but the last two visits the rooms need remodeling. This last stay the drawers were falling out of the dresser, a hole punched through the bathroom door didn't even raise an eyebrow from the staff.	3.0
We had a great visit at the Comfort Suites. The hotel room was spacious (we had a small adjoining 'living room' space in addition to the bedroom), and the room was really clean. The bed was extremely comfortable (great pillows!). We had pleasant interactions with the front desk, who were more than happy to help us with any questions we... More	5.0
Good: Bar had a good atmosphere, room was really cute.	5.0
The breakfast could have been better by including some hot foods. The bed and pillows were very comfy. The rooms was nice and clean. The staff was very friendly.	5.0
The front desk associate Brad was great, I really enjoyed my check-in and check-out through him. The buffet breakfast was also a great deal that I included in my package and if your traveling with kids the kiddie pool was pretty cool too.	5.0
Having stayed at several Embassy Suites, this one in Crystal City does not meet the expectation of Embassy Suite standards. The hotel's only restaurant does not have much to offer as compared to the 3 restaurants of Marriott Hotel which is next door. The front desk people needs further training in Customer Service. Granted that they may be college students, their customer service needs to focus on the needs of the Customer such as inquiring if there are any questions we may have regarding the town i.e, restaurants, shopping, metro transit. The only thing that is great w/ this place is their full breakfast.	3.0
I had a room reserved for me by the National Guard for july 15th and 16th. About 5:30 is when i showed up to the hotel on the evening of the 15th. I told the lady at the front desk that i had this reservation for tonight and that the national guard was the ones who had set it up... More	1.0

When I came into my room, I did a check for dust(I'm allergic) and found a rather thick collection on the headboard and lampshades.

Stayed at this hotel with their package deal of renting a room and leaving your car in the parking lot for a price of 159.99 while you fly away. Car was broken into and they refuse to pay for the damages. No responsibility. do not stay here do not trust them.Thank you for your response. Unfortunately, the airport market has had a recent wave of car vandalism. With the help of police and third party security monitoring our parking lot, we fortunately have been able to stop these car break-ins. We understand how frustrating this situation is and again would like to extend our apologies. We want you to know that we will continue to work with local police to ensure our hotel, parking lot and city are safe.	1.0
I had to stay for one night in Milledgeville for business. My company participates in a Corporate Lodging program so my options in an area are predetermined and limited.

I'm surprised this hotel is even part of the Best Western chain. They supplied only one wash cloth. We got a conditioner bottle, but no shampoo. Our food was thrown away even though we had it neatly stored in a box on the coffee table. The buffet breakfast was lacking. It had stale donuts and danish. The only hot food was hard boiled eggs and grits. On the positive side, bed was comfortable and good front desk service.	2.0

Before I booked this hotel I reviewed comments and rating which indicated I would be satisfied. Unfortunately, I was highly DISAPPOINTED! The hotel elevator had a bad smell, my air conditioner worked best at night, I could hear my neighbors conversation and to make my stay really memorable someone was banging on a hotel door. As for security the hotel has a door that is NOT locked and is located next to the elevator. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL!	2.0
Quality Inn's service is the best of all the hotels i had stayed in my last trip. Location wise hotel was well placed next to the freeway, Hotel Rooms are very spacious. Breakfast spread is basic. Hotel has ample parking.	5.0
Nice location in a newer area (Eastside of Naples, just off I-75) that was quiet and surprisingly clean and comfortable. I felt the 3 star rating was below the value we received. Cordial staff, very clean and complimentary breakfast was real food! Nice.	5.0
We just returned home from a 6-night stay at the Hyatt Grand Cypress in Orlando. I was impressed with all of that the hotel and its staff did to insure its guests had a great time.

Comfortable bed for the night. My first impression was quite good for the price. Then I opened the closet door and discovered the garbage from a previous guest (ancient pizza in box, used plates, used napkins) stacked inside. Looked like it had been there a long, long time. It's amazing how fast your impression of a place can change. Wish the person at the desk had been a little more concerned about it when I told her. I did not leave with a great impression of the place.	2.0
I didn't like the size of the rooms, not as big as I thought they would be. I liked the central location to Downtown Boston.	5.0

Stayed here for a third time, again because it was the venue for the meeting at which I was invited to speak.

I have stayed at this location many times, never have I been disappointed. I plan to stay again in September for Center homecoming activities. I would recommend this location to anyone staying in Center for business or pleasure.	4.0
Overall our stay was very nice, the room was clean and housekeeping was great about providing new towels/sheets/paper etc... The guy at the front desk had a terrible attitude but it might've been because he was working the overnight shift . All in all we enjoyed our stay and got to stay for 3 nights for a reasonable price 314	3.0
comfortable bed. microwave, fridge. sink area separate area from bathroom. Very clean. Did not have breakfast as it ends at 9:30 and we missed it so can't comment. Not a luxury hotel but quiet and great value for the price of 62. night. Convenient to I75.	4.0

We stayed at the Redwood when we were looking for a reasonably priced motel for the SuperBowl weekend. (It is quite a ways from the Super Bowl site.) Considering the price, the Redwood was a good motel and was very clean. It's older, but managment seems to be working hard to maintain a reasonble place to stay.	4.0
This is the 2nd time we stay at this hotel. Everyone is friendly and the rooms are very comfortable. The shuttle driver is very nice and he's always on time. Great breakfast and service. We would definitely stay there everytime we would visit DC.	4.0
The Dana is a vast property with tremendous views of mission bay. Located right on the bay front with excellent water views. Watersports on site. 2 big pools and 2 hot tubs. They have kids movies in the swimming pool area on certain nights. Cons: - Small bathroom / toilet - Small sink - tiny and located outside the bathroom.	5.0
The only complaints that I have is that the indoor pool was out of service for a day and half which wasn't good for the kids. Our balcony door stuck really, really bad! The light in the bathroom is also the fan so you can't be in there without the fan going. Hard to hear what is going on in the room with the loud noise running all the time.	3.0
I am a gold elite member with the Marriott brand. We stayed here earlier this month. I didn't have time to get around to making a complaint because we were getting things done for my mother in law's funeral. First off the first room we were given smelled like mildew. It was disgusting. So I went to the front desk and was given a second room next door to this room. It did not smell any better. So I was given a third room this time in the main building. So we move our things to this room. I brush my teeth and get into bed it was then 1:00am approximately. I lay on the right side of the bed and the bed breaks!! I am about 180 pounds why is the bed breaking I fall out of the bed and hit my head on the corner of the night stand. At this point I am beyond furious. I calmly walk back to the lobby and explain to the gentleman. He apologizes and I am given a fourth room. The next morning I go to down to talk to the manager but the manager is in a meeting and the lady at the front desk rudely tells me the guy from night shift comped my room what else do I want. I could've of choked the ignorant lady. So I checkout and move to a different hotel. A manager named Patrick calls and leaves a voicemail the next afternoon. I called Patrick back multiple times and left voicemails. Never received a phone call at all or email nothing. We have stayed at this hotel for almost 5 years in a row. It's the only hotel we stay at in Anaheim. This is beyond ridiculous. Category 6 this place should be more of an 2 or 3. I have stayed at nicer category 3,4,5 hotels. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. Is this the type of name Marriott wants for itself Should I take my loyalty to a different brand Dear floydmcmillan2007,Good Day, Please accept my sincere apology on behalf of Towne place suites Anaheim, I am very sorry to learn that your experience with us during your visit was not up to your par .

Everything about this hotel is geared to the DC business traveler. Nothing is missing from the standpoint of communications inclusive of wireless net access. They provide more than just coffee and danish in the morning there is real food. Plus snack items designed to help you make it through a difficult day on the Hill. Convenience to the Metro is a big plus, and it's provided by a shuttle. Wait staff goes out of its way to accommodate and address problems if any. We have, of course, other options as far as where to stay in the DC area, but this Best Western has my vote hands down right price, right place, right service. It's a winning hand all the way.	5.0

Short walk to conference at Minute Made Park, hotel being renovated and I was in a new room that was small but perfect for my needs with a Queen bed, desk and swivel chair, comfortable arm chair, good size shower in adequate size bathroom. Only thing missing was a shelf or stand for my suitcase. A lot of construction in the neighborhood but I heard nothing.	5.0

Fine place to stay with the kiddos. Nice staff, close to restaurants and short drive to downtown. Indoor pool is a bit chilly.	4.0
Not the quality expected for a Grand Hyatt. Great location to shops, restaurants, beach. Many more children of all ages than expected for this time of year therefore the pool area became less desirable. That was unfortunate because the pool area is certainly one of the main attractions of this hotel. Have stayed here before and do not remember this issue.	3.0
We were taken aback by the staff, especially Jalan who since we walked in took care of us. We felt like royalty! They secured a bottled of champagne and treats for our 22nd wedding anniversary ... so very kind! The hotel is lovely, a boutique stay with a Hilton flair. Its modern but not over the top. Very clean and very comfortable with a great rooftop bar. It is not in the French Quarter so beware we actually liked that as we know NOLA well. Surely a destination to be considered. Thank you for taking the time to write this wonderful review of your anniversary celebration at our hotel. We love to hear back when we not only meet but exceed expectations. Jalan is certainly a rising star on our staff and has been commended for his efforts in taking great care of you. It was our pleasure to have you as our guest and hope to have you back for another visit very soon.Sincerely,	5.0
We visited for a game at FedEx field and took some time to also enjoy DC. This hotel fit out needs for both. Wish the breakfast was longer during the week for those looking to get some shuteye since it was our vacation :) we opted for Starbucks across the street instead of waking for a buffet that closed at 9am. Shuttle to metro station was super convenient. One elevator broke leaving the whole hotel to function in chaos since the stairs were only for emergency. Carpet in our room was heavy soiled and in need of replacement. Only thing missing was a pool.....	4.0

Bad: I had to be switched because these people next door were partying all hours of the night. At 3am they decided to start arguing in the hall. I called security once for them to turn up their music right after they left. Then security came up again while they were in the hall screaming. I will say this the hotel made it right. They gave me that night free and switched me rooms. Good: The rooms were beautiful. Comfy beds good breakfast.	5.0

Stayed two nights over parents weekend in October. The bleak exterior and entrance was a little off-putting, so we were pleasantly surprised by the size and condition of the room. The heat wasn't working, so it was pretty cold, but it was obvious they were doing their best to fix it so we toughed it out the first night. They supplied a space heater the next morning, but then moved us to another room (just as clean and comfortable) the second night. The hotel was full but we never heard our neighbors. Bathroom and breakfast were basic. Staff was friendly. Odd-numbered rooms face rear/away from street and parking lot. Recommended for quick stay.	4.0
The room was very small, to have a full and queen size bed in it. And I clean home for a living and the bath room needs really down to using a tooth brush around the tub and floor, and I took the empty toilet paper roll out to put in the new one and the dirt I saw behind that empty roll was bad I left it out so the house keeper would see the dirt and what ever else was in there. And another chair in the room would be nice, a person can only set on the bed for just a little while then the back hurts.	2.0
I loved the hotel very clean comfortable! Great staff will stay again if im ever in the area!	5.0

Spent one night here after travelling from Orlando through the Everglades and the Keys. Excellent first impression, clean, bright lobby, quick check in and a fantastic concierge who provided us with maps and advised on local attractions, etc. The room was a good size with TV, fridge, adequate storage space and complimentary toiletries and hairdryer in the bathroom. I was travelling with a friend and had booked a King room prior to arrival (there had been no other options on the website), however, reception offered us double queen room at no extra cost on check in. Breakfast consisted of hot and cold items sausage patties, eggs, waffles, bagels, toast, pastries, cereal, yoghurt, orange juice, tea/coffee. Good quality and plenty available. Available in the lobby and included in the room rate.The only thing that lets this hotel down slightly is the location. The main Street in Key West is Duval street, which is a good hours walk from the hotel. A taxi costs upwards of 20 dollars. We had a rental car and ended up driving a lot of the street parking is permit only and the car parks are expensive but we managed to park for free on a residential street. Perhaps a shuttle to and from the hotel would be a nice extra touch.A good hotel, would stay again if travelling back to Key West.Thank you for your comments and feedback. So glad you enjoyed your visit to our property and had an excellent first impression. The team does an amazing job maintaining the cleanliness of the rooms, and getting our guest checked in quickly so they can enjoy the Island. Thanks for staying with us. Hope to see you back soon.	4.0

We will be back!Mich, MISHA is amazing! We are glad you chose our hotel for the B-Day celebration and that we took good care of you. Of course you don't have to wait for his birthday to come back, we can help write a new Rx if needed: Phillies, Bell, Parkway, Casino, Shopping, Kimmel Center, Concerts, Theater, just to name a few :) See you soon!

This hotel was recently opened 7 months ago and used to be a bank. The room was clean, spotless and very comfortable. I was traveling in business and it was smack bang in the middle of centre city with easy access to everything. There was a TV in the room with loads of channels to keep you occupied. The shower and toilet were very clean. The only thing I'd say is for the shampoo and shower gel provided to be fragranced..that's just my preference.The staff were get polite esp Walter and Troy..thanks boys for making my stay welcoming..it was great to chat with you guys and sorry I didn't get to say goodbye properly. I can't comment on breakfast or food as I didn't have this and I don't drink so cannot comment on the bar.Lastly the vibe was really nice and Noamaan, Now that's a headline! We are shooting for 7 stars but there are rules about what defines star or diamond level. Those ratings are related to amenities instead of service. That's why we love TripAdvisor! It provides real stories about real experiences in hotels. Thanks for sharing yours. We appreciate the 5 star review. I will share the shout outs with Walter and Troy, though I suspect they're watching too...Hope to have you back soon!	5.0

The location is nice as well as the hotel staff, but is not a good place to stay if you need to get any sleep at night.

One of the hotel staff just walked into our room no knocking and then stared at us blankly asking if we had checked in.

My visit to Hampton Inn Jackson, Tn was an awesome experience !! The customer service I received from the associates named Rufus Tonie were exemplary and at the highest standards of customer satisfaction. Everyone on staff went over above to make sure my stay was an excellent experience. I will definitely be staying at this location again.	5.0

We enjoy this hotel because of the room service, the lounge bar in the first floor and our favorite is the iridescence resturant in the top of the building. Im also a big fan of the. D. Tour spa. I'm not a big gambler and I think the casino is over crowded most of the time but I still like... More	5.0
For the price and location (Burnet) this was a nice place to stay. Rooms are old but have been updated. Clean rooms, friendly staff, pretty good breakfast. It was great for a one night stay, would stay again for similar circumstance.	4.0
Bad: The pillows were flat. Good: It was a great location close to everything. The bathroom was newly remodeled and beautiful! The bed was average but I got good night's sleep.	5.0
Bad: One of the things we did not like was the fact that we couldn't wake up to a cup of coffee in the morning without paying an arm and a leg for one. The other was that they should at least offer free coffee and beverages to their customers. Washington State casino have a coffee and soda machines for their customers to enjoy as they play. I also do not like the idea of casinos shoving resorts fees down a person throat when they know that the percentage of customers do not use the resorts. Good: I enjoyed the friendly staff.	5.0
Wifi was way too slow to be able to do much.	3.0
We usually look for Drury Inns when we travel. This location is very convenient off the highway. I liked the out door area by the pool. We had a great suite, highly suggest the suites to families. The mall is across the parking lot and convenient.	5.0
We enjoyed our experience at the Honue Kai Resort. We stayed in a one bedroom suite with views of the west Maui mountains. There is a small industrial space across the street that we could see (and smell at times), but we dont feel like it took away too much from the ambiance of the place. If you can, get... More	4.0
we have stayed at the drury near the Atlanta airport for the last 3 years. great accomodations, friendly staff, affordable, clean, ample parking, etc. very family friendly. will continue to stay here when I have to go to Atlanta	5.0
The staff was very polite from check in to check out. The room was well above the value one would get at some of the other facilities in the area. The room was very clean, substantial space and easy to get to. If I needed to stop again I wouldn't even bother with any of the other options in the... More	4.0
Bad: No customer service and they try to bill you for everything, for everything. Good: I wish customer service would reply to my emails. I should be getting a refund, but Booking has never replied to my emails. I guess this was my first time and last time using Booking.com. Worst stay ever.	1.0
I continue to find Hampton Inn the best choice for a chain hotel in the moderate price range. This hotel is no exception to the standard I have come to expect -- immaculate bathrooms, comfortable beds and a hearty, basic breakfast.	5.0
Very helpful and friendly staff, always taking care of my needs. Special thank you to Analy and Omar Andrade for responding to my requests. Lots of warm smiles and willingness to make you feel at home.	5.0
We checked in late Tuesday as we were in town for a funeral. We chose to stay here b/c it was close. First room key wouldn't work. The second one did but only that night. Every day we have been here we've had to make a trip downstairs to get a new key b/c they never work by the time... More	1.0
Bad: The fact that we were not able to take advantage of the heated indoor pool..it closes 9:00pm does not re-open until 4:00 pm the following day... Good: The accessibility to area attractions the breakfast bar was wonderful!	3.0
The Hotel Was Everything I Expected. Very Reasonable price, being that is 2 Blocks away from New Orleans French Quarter. This gave me the freedom to not worry about Parking or transportation to or from the party life of NOLA. I will continue to visit each and Everytime I come to Louisiana.	5.0
I BOOKED THE HOTEL THRU HOTELS.COM. I ASKED FOR A ROOM WITH A BALCONY BUT NOT ON THE GROUND FLOOR. THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. THE MANAGER CALLED THE ROOM AND SAID THEY WOULD CHANGE US TO A 2ND FLOOR ROOM THE NEXT DAY. I ALSO NOTED THAT WE WERE IN TOWN FOR A FUNERAL, SO WE DID NOT HAVE TIME TO CHANGE IN AND OUT OF ROOMS. WE WERE THERE FOR 2 NIGHTS. ON THE NEXT DAY OUR ROOM WAS SUPPOSED TO BE CLEANED THERE WAS A NOTE LEFT FROM HOUSE KEEPING STATING THAT THEY DID NOT CHANGE THE BED BECAUSE WE LEFT LUGGAGE ON THE BED(THAT WAS NEW FOR ME. WE HAVE STAYED AT RESIDENCE INN AND THAT WAS NEVER AN ISSUE). THE WORSE PART WAS THAT THE HOUSEKEEPING STAFF LEFT THE DOOR TO THE ROOM OPEN. WHEN WE ARRIVED BACK FROM THE FUNERAL LATE THAT EVENING THE DOOR WAS OPEN. WE DIDN'T KNOW IF SOMEONE WAS IN THE ROOM CLEANING OR IF IT WAS AN INTRUDER. MY HUSBAND JUST PUSHED IT OPEN AND THERE WAS NO ONE THERE, THE DOOR WAS JUST LEFT OPEN. NOT VERY RESPONSIBLE ON THEIR PART. I HAD SOME JEWELRY AND A LAPTOP IN THE ROOM.	3.0
We enjoyed our lunch at the St. Regis. From the service to the food and drink, everything was impeccable. The setting is classic and polished, comfortable and beautiful. It was our first time at the St. Regis and we will return. Highly recommended.Dear mnkittycat, Thank you so much for having lunch at The St. Regis New York. We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager	5.0
Bad: The hotel just didn't quite match up to the pics we saw online. The room was quite dirty, a few hairs were on the one bathrobe that I guess we were suppose to share between two. No help with bags on arrival or departure. No complimentary water. Shower was not clean at all and light above it was out. Had to ask three times for it to be changed. Grout had gone silver and the actual tiles hadn't been properly cleaned in ages, you could tell by marks that appeared when it steamed up. Toilet was all yellowed around the seat rim. Splashes on wallpaper down back of toilet and across from toilet too. Toiletries provided in large bottles where the tops of the pumps had ingrained dirt. Horrible. Floor in room was covered in marks and the windows were filthy. It all smelt a bit stale too. Lighting is low I think to hide what's actually not very clean. Drawers were full of little bits of white dust and paper, clearly never been checked or cleaned. Ironing board was so bad you had to put two towels on it to avoids marks on clothing. We got an ok deal through booking.com but had we paid full rate I would've been really unhappy. Location just wasn't for us, right by Union square, we would've preferred somewhere more local but other people may like that. First room we were given had a great view of a... wall. :( Breakfast not provided yet no suggestions of where to go when there's an amazing diner a block away. Staff (apart from the girl who checked us in) weren't very helpful at all. Good: The bed was comfy	2.0
Good: Great property! Excellent team of young dedicated profeccionals	5.0
We were extremely pleased and surprised with our stay at this hotel. The staff was extremely helpful and went out of the way to make our stay comfortable. There was a lifeguard at the pool and 2 computers in the lobby with internet access that we could use anytime we wanted, which we never expected. There was a full breakfast every morning which was superb! There was a shuttle to the Metro that ran from 7am-10pm and anywhere within 3 miles of the hotel, but you had to be prepared to wait. The hotel is walking distance to Springfield Mall and restaurants. Don't rent a car to go to WA DC as the Metro will get you within walking distance of the major attractions, saving you time and money. If we go back to DC we will stay there again.	5.0
In the words of Shirley Bassey: Where do I begin Jajaja. Well the rooms are sumptuous and big! Especially by NYC standards and compared to hotels of the same category. The service is amazing you feel pampered all throughout your stay. The food unfortunately is not up to the standard of the hotel. This doesn't mean it's bad at all, yet nothing spectacular. And last but not least the best part is that it has the best location!Dear CutbertoParraNicolin, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager	5.0
The hotel has lovely quiet rooms always cleaned and polished. The staff are friendly and efficient. Even on busy memorial weekend the place did not feel too crapped or rushed. It's sad to see their luxury 'Skies' rooftop revolving restaurant has gone bust.We had to eat dinner the first night at the 'Spectator's' bar which was awful. We went back for drinks later at night and the main bartender was rude, he fitted right into the ambiance of this nasty little nugget.The breakfast buffet is always one of the highlights of my stay at this establishment. It's reasonably priced with top quality selection and service. The terrace view is calming with all the trees and water fountains babbling in the background.The pool was just 'remodeled' for memorial weekend but as always it was over packed and there were about 15 chaise lounge chairs for a large hotel. The hotel must buy some chairs for the clients. We had to sit on the concrete both days with our 2 year old. Next time we will bring our own chairs.I talked to the staff who said the entire hotel is in a remodel phase and I'm sure they will address these minor details. I may have griped a bit that I still love the hotel it just needs some minor adjustments. If your with family and need a dinner just go down to the Westin through The Link they have a bar/restaurant that actually has main courses and cooked food with vegetables.	4.0
Husband and I planned to stop in Blythe as a rest/sleep stop on the way back from sedona. Very clean and comfortable place to lay your head for a night. Bountiful free breakfast as well. The checkin/out process seems to need some work but it's a new hotel so that is to be expected.	4.0
Came here after a 7 hour drive down from Nags head and it was the perfect stop- definitely worth more than the 3*!! It's lovely- cute little outdoor pool- lovely large room, I made use of the gym and it was amazing! Loads of equipment- would definitely stay again!	5.0

Bad: Nown. Good: None	4.0
It was a recently built hotel allowed to fall into disrepair. Staff was gone or unhelpful. Room felt like a motel 6. Maybe. Was ok for 85. But no more. View of interstate exit ramp. I would recommend most other places. It did in a pinch and was close to dc. Didn't feel unsafe. Just unkept. It was fine to sleep in. And the pool was nice.	2.0
The whole experience was fantastic, very enjoyable and relaxing. All of the staff were super to deal with. The drinks were good and the food was super. Having a paper each day was very good along with excellent internet service.	5.0
We stayed for 4 nights with 6 others couples. Check-in was a only 10 minutes when we arrived Thursday around 7pm (although I did notice longer lines at other times during our stay). Our room was great with a strip view - spacious, super comfy bed, lovely shower/bath area and lots of wardrobe/drawer space. Our only room complaint was that... More	5.0
Stayed here for one night passing through. We loved it. Room was nice and comfy! Great river view. Just ask for it. It's located in the heart of downtown so traffic is chaotic. Busy town. Parking is expensive. Self park is 24 in the public parking w/ validation around the corner from the hotel. Valid parking is 43. Everything is in walking distance so park the car and just walk. No point in driving. Ever been to Paris Kind of like that.	5.0
Awesome staff - excellent on providing customer service	4.0

Convenient location to a delicious steakhouse next door, comfy pillows, and friendly service. Will definitely stay again!	4.0

First time to stay at a My Place hotel. Stayed overnight on our way to Yellostone. Beds and bedding were wonderful! Room was clean and reasonably priced. Allows pets and had sufficient walking area. Will look for them again. However, no king beds.	5.0
My husband and I enjoyed our stay here. It's better than the reviews depict. We really appreciated Gary and all of his advice regarding the hotel and the city! ***just prepare to pay for parking. We weren't expecting this.. Roughly 27 per day	3.0
We found Indigo through searching on Trip Advisor. We were looking for a unique, boutique type hotel with competitive rates. We loved this hotel!

This hotel or what they call themselves motel poses an excellent location in the downtown , with fair value you will not find competitive hotel has the same or near value , free parking is a big bonus, Staff are very polite and treat you as family member	5.0
Location not too bad. Close to lots of restaurant. There were blood on the sheets, I informed the front desk and they didn't even come to change it.	1.0
This was our first stay at this hotel though we generally stay at a Hampton Inn when travelling. This was by far the worst condition we've ever found a Hampton in. I believe a renovation and upgrade throughout the hotel would benefit this location greatly.	3.0
I really hope someone in the hotel groups management reads this. I will give a little background on the situation. The first part is completely out of the hotels control and I don't blame them for any of it, but their part in what happened to me and my mother last night is frankly disgusting. My dad passed away quite... More	1.0

Room musty and not well ventilated. No hot water in show despite multiple trips to the front desk to ask for assistance or another room. Front desk staff asked if I turned the knob the opposite way Hotel staff made no effort to move us to another room or fix the problem. Will not be staying here again.	2.0
We came for a weekend getaway with friends and our third time at the Aria. We have tried other properties and just feel the Aria is the best-- perfect location, incredible restaurants, wonderful pool and fitness areas... And don't forget the smell when you enter the lobby-- I'm pretty convinced that's what Heaven smells like!	5.0
Loved this little town! The hotel was very comfortable and quiet. Older hotel but nicely refurbished with funky decor and good quality furniture and bedding. Staff was very friendly, efficient and helpful. Rooms are a bit small so wouldn't recommend for more than two people to a room. We would definitely stay here again!	3.0
This property provided us with an extremely enjoyable stay, the beds were excellent, the dcor and cleanliness excellent. the food outstanding, our BEST stay at a Best Western. If we are ever in this neck of the woods again, we will definitely stay at this Best Western.	5.0
Bad: We had booked 2 rooms for our 3 night Boston trip - King Room for us and a Double Double (ie with 2 double beds) for our teenagers. I booked this in December for our July visit. I emailed twice before arrival to request that the rooms were close by (on the same floor) and both times got no reply - and that should have alerted me and to be honest sums up 'Boxer Customer Service'. On arrival we were told that there were no rooms available with 2 beds, the guy on reception seemed clueless how to help us. Our teenagers were supposedly 'upgraded' to a suite where my son had to sleep on a sofa / pull out bed (or share a King size bed with his sister). Totally unacceptable - I booked these rooms 6 months in advance. All in all we had interactions with 4 different staff members (including someone from Accounts who had to process a compensation refund) and at no time did either my wife nor I feel like the Customer . . . . you know the kind The PAYING Customer! So in terms of Comfort score - low because my son was on a sofa bed for 3 nights. In terms of Value for Money - low 1800 and my 16 year old son gets a sofa bed In terms of Staff score - low because they are in serious need of some Customer Service training. Good: The Boxer in Boston SHOULD be a fantastic hotel - it's a great building, location is excellent (we were able to explore everything that Boston has to offer from there), rooms are a good size but overall our stay was not as good as it should have been. Came away from our 3 night stay (planned and booked 6 months earlier) just feeling like we had been let down . . . .	3.0

We had an excellent stay. The hotel is conveniently located off the freeway, easy to find, with 3 restaurants within walking distance.

Stayed there just for a weekend trip for a wedding and was pleasantly surprised by how nice the hotel was for the price!

Brilliant place. Just wish we had spent more time as we only stayed one night, as we used as a base to see the Grand Canyon. We all really enjoyed the complementary full breakfast. Lovely double rooms with plenty of space	5.0
Good: Staff is very nice.	4.0
I'm a neat freak and this hotel felt comfortable. Very spacious too, we stayed in a resort view room and it has a living room with a t.v. and a sofa bed room with a separate t.v. and closet. The room comes with a washer and dryer too which was a plus and they use Aveda products for the bathroom.	4.0
No restaurant- you still need to go to Benvenutos at the Holiday inn. But sparkling clean and new. Nice staff and good location. Basic and serviceable. No issues, would probably choose to stay he again instead of the main hotel. Short walk.	3.0
Bad: The only draw back is the noise at night from th people coming in and out of the lounge and adjacent nightclub. Though it didn't bother us personally. Good: I loved how central the location was. The hotel is in the theatre district. We walked to the harbour as well as Shopping and all the parks around us. After a long day of walking around we enjoyed A massage at the Bliss spa. We also enjoyed having a drink at the lounge before going to bed. It was a great experience for us. It might be too noisy for people who want peace and quite. I also had the best sleep in those beds. I would recommend staying at the W Boston.	5.0
We have stayed here several times and it is always the same, clean, quiet, not too expensive. Although it did cost 20 bucks a night now for a dog. The staff is always friendly and helpful. The breakfast is pretty good too.	5.0

I've stayed at this hotel twice both times in November. Perhaps it's just because it's a slow season in that area, both times I got a GREAT sleep. Peace and quiet and a clean room is all I ask. The hotel strikes me as a property that was redone (or built) in the 2000s. The linen and furnishing, wall coverings,... More	4.0

I liked the place, the rooms were spacious. Beds were comfortable. Breakfast was OK, nothing spectacular. Only problem I noticed was the room was full of ants, plus there was a long skinny bug when I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The Bahama Breeze next door was convenient.	4.0

This was a very nice hotel for the price. The room was very clean and the hotel staff was nice. Close to many restaurants and other business establishments.

This Hyatt is a great place. Clean, quiet, friendly staff, nice bar, great happy hour, well located and responsive to your needs. We will stay here again without a doubt.

Everyone was very friendly. The breakfast lady Sunday morning was more interested in talking to people then keeping bar filled and clean. She should be able to do both. I had a knee cart and she would see me trying to get around chairs and tables and just continued to talk to someone and did not help. I had surgery on my foot and needed a place with no stairs for few days. The room was comfortable, spacious and clean. I enjoyed the front porch to sit. Out during the day to get fresh air. Overall the stay was great. Would do it again just to get away for a couple days.	5.0

Bad: It was perfect, period!. Good: What's there not to like The wonderful staff at the Westin even guessed we were getting married in Vegas and, to our total surprise, when we got back to the hotel after our wedding ceremony, we had a bottle of champagne and chocolate-coated strawberries waiting for us. The hotel's restaurant, the Savona Bistro, simply has the best angus burger in the world! The location, for those of us who prefer to skip the hustle and bustle of the Strip: perfect!	5.0

Excellent in all areas: staff, suite, helpfulness, extremely clean, housekeeping a real plus, location , beach view, very close to shopping and restaurants. I could live here full time.

My daughter, granddaughter and I stayed one night. The front desk lady seemed very stressed and was in a pretty bad mood. We were told to come back after 3 pm to check-in.

I have become a very loyal customer of Best Western in the last 2 years. This stay before and after my cruise the hotel just proved that I have not wasted my loyalty. Everything was clean, staff was friendly, pool was wonderful, etc... This is why I stay Best Western. They haven't let me down yet.	5.0
We had a wonderful week at the Best Western in Lacey. Each day they would have different breakfast foods which was great. The room was very comfortable, the only issue was the size of the pillows. I thought they were too small for a king size room. I asked about them, but that was all they had. We would still... More	5.0

Bad: We only had one robe in our room and no slippers, but we weren't bothered enough to ask for these from the front desk. Good: We loved our stay at the W Boston! The room was a great size and the bed huge and comfortable. The staff was so accommodating taking delivery of two packages for me and bringing them up to the room. I didn't use the Bliss spa on site, but it is an amazing spa so I will definitely visit next time!	5.0
Very friendly front desk staff. Clean comfortable lobby and sitting area. Great breakfast. Make your own waffles, biscuits, gravy, bacon, eggs. The rooms nice and spacious. The beds were comfortable.

We arrived at the beginning of July for a 7 night stay. Check in was quick staff friendly. We were upgraded to a room with a kingsize bed given free wifi on the 11th floor.Throughout our stay our room was kept spotless with fresh towels and shampoos etc refilled on a daily basis. On our last day we were able to stay in our room until 13.00hrs at no extra charge then our suitcases stored by the staff for 1 per case.We asked about purchasing a jar of cookies to bring home but unfortunately they were not available until 17.00hrs, however seeing the disappointment on our faces Jessica went the extra mile spoke with management we were able to purchase two tins We also were given a few free ones to have on our journey home!We will definitely return to this hotel when we are next back in New York. Ideal location and close enough to be within a short walk of Times Square but away from the hustle bustle of all the crowds. Thank you to all the staff at this hotel.Thanks for sharing this lovely review, Kathryn!We're thrilled to hear you enjoyed your stay with us at our prime location to Times Square. It's our pleasure to accommodate you and we appreciate your praise. Jessica is an excellent member of our team. She always goes above and beyond for our guests. You can see why we love having her here so much!We're looking forward to sharing another amazing experience with you soon. Have a beautiful day!	5.0
We were on a family trip and had an unexpected overnight. Pulled up, walked in, were treated well, and check in was a breeze. The pool facility was nice, the room was clean and nearly brand new. The breakfast was everything you needed. The parking lot felt safe and have 0 complaints or concerns about this property.	5.0

After many years of visiting our two Clemson college students, not to mention the campus visits prior to those college years, we have stayed at many area hotels. This is by far my favorite.

The room was outdated but yet cozy. Love the fireplace in the room. Even though no hot tub in our room we still had a relaxing time. Blast from the past! I would ask for or bring an extra blanket can get a little chilly if the fire place goes out. Will go back and stay again soon. Room 213	3.0

Had a fantastic stay at the Troubadour. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful with suggestions for restaurants. The hotel was clean and modern. The only negative was that the walls are very thin but didn't bother us too much. Everything else well surpassed my expectations. Thank you very much for the five star review!!! We love to hear that we exceeded just about all expectations which is our ultimate goal with all of our guests. Please know that our walls were actually built thicker than what was recommended for a hotel when we completed this renovation, may have been a case of noisy neighbors that we could always try to assist with once reported.We appreciate you staying with us and do hope to have you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,	5.0

For trip to Dollywood.was impressed with display of HE is Risen on electronic sign. Nice to see a business not afraid to display Christian belief.	4.0
Overall it was pretty good...the staff were excellent..the free breakfast was GREAT. However, the shower didn't produce cold water until the 3rd person took a shower. Also, we didn't have a refridgerator in the room, so left overs from resturants were out of the question. But loved to have the ability to take a shuttle to the Metro Station, that then took me the DC so I didn't have to drive for a tour of DC. GREAT!!!	4.0
Great hotel, very friendly desk personnel. You should note online and on phone that your free hotel shuttle is for dfw only. I called and confirmed that I was flying in but no one asked me which airport, I had to take a 30 cab each way. That would have made a difference in my choice of hotels or flights.	5.0
Beds not very comfortable, and the price was quite steep (even realizing it was Labor Day weekend and many Inns raise their rates) otherwise: very clean, well-appointed, convenient to many dining places and lake activities.	5.0
Great location walking distance close to all down town ....bathroom too small, the rest was ok. The restaurant was not working so we had to go to other places around for meals.... People were vey nice	4.0
Bad: Pool crowded with local moms tots. Would love common gathering room, all designated common space is also used for meetings and were booked while we were there.

I like the renovated hotel for its small size and location to Old Town. Being a renovated hotel, each room had radiator heat and a standing air conditioning unit both of which can be very loud, but provide some white noise so you dont hear the train whistle.

Great central location for exploring downtown Napa and the Napa Valley. Good access from HWY 29, HWY 12, and HWY 128. There are plenty of much more expensive choices in the Napa area, but saving a few on lodging allows for stretching for great local food and wine.Thank you for your review and I am glad we were a great place to stop on your visit to the Napa Valley. We aim to be the best value for your in Napa. Hope to see you again in the near future.	4.0
The ladies at the front desk were friendly and always helpful! We love Drury's free drinks and food! The room was nice! The pool did not seem very clean. Great location! Relight by ballpark village and the Arch. We walked to dinner and an ice cream place (about a half a mile). Overall we had a great experience. We would go back!	4.0
The hotel is very basic but the room we stayed in was clean and comfortable. After staying at other Best Western hotels, this hotel could include many more amenties. The hotel had an odor that was not pleasing, 1 of 2 elavators was out of service. Breakfast items were plentiful but the staff could not keep up during peak times and the buffet area got very messy. The front desk service employees were helpful and polite. I would not go back to this hotel inspite of the good price.	3.0
This is an excellent property. It really fits the resort catagory. The king bed I had was very comfortable and the room had enough space to relax and work. Evry room has a balcony.

Very helpful and friendly staff, overall a good stay with just a few hickups. Breakfast had a nice variety and overall good. The room was nice and clean except for a large bug that I disposed of. Location was on a dead end street that was odd to get too but OK once you had it figured out.	4.0
After a long 2-week trip we stayed in this hotel. It was so luxurious, everything was just perfect. The best hotel I have ever stayed. The staff was also outstanding, especially Danny at the Front Desk. Hope we will be back.	5.0

This Hotel was amazing. My husband and I came here for one night to celebrate our 4 year wedding anniversary. The staff was very accommodating and let us check in early. Andrew the front desk guy was awesome and sent us a bottle of champagne after I told him why we were here. The room was nice and spacious and the shower is on another level. There are lots of restaurants near by and places to walk to. The light rail is right next to the hotel so it was super easy to get to the restaurants and bars further downtown. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you Andrew for making our stay amazing!Hello Amanda D, We thought you were pretty amazing too! I'll definitely share your accolades with the rest of the team. We hope you can try our restaurant, MATCH Restaurant and Lounge next time you stay. We hope to see you again soon.Thanks!	5.0

The beds, pillows and linens were fine. The A/C and other pipe noises were loud and you could hear everything going on in the hallway. The tub filled from a shower and took forever to drain. Furniture is worn and dated. Beach was great and so was the pool. For the price and since we knew we wouldn't be in the room much, it was okay but next trip to Virginia Beach we'll try a different place.	3.0

Very convenient location to Downtown Seattle. Its located right across the Space Needle. We only stayed here for 1 night. They have very good and delicious breakfast! Omelette was a hit! Front Desk and Dining room staffs were very Friendly. We arrived on time to check in so that we have more time to see Seattle. But, our room was not ready. We waited for couple of hours in the lobby before it became available. What Not very impressive!Then the whole night our wifi wasnt working. They said they will reset the router as soon the Technician arrives but it was already too late. We had to check out early for our City Tour and our cruise Housekeeping I think they have to pay more attention in terms of their room services. Towels and toiletries supplies were not enough to accommodate 5 people. We had to request some more supplies. After a couple of hours we waited for the availability of our room We expected way better!	3.0

Just got back from an amazing weekend at the St. Regis. We used our starpoints to reserve a night at the St. Regis in celebration of our anniversary. I had high hopes for a Category 7 hotel - and St. Regis did not disappoint! We'd had a bit of a rough journey, but from the moment Pascal took our bags to Jose at the front desk checking us in, Ildna showing me to the fitness room where I could have a little workout before our room was ready - everyone took such great care of us. We will definitely be back!Dear Traveller94115, We are very pleased to learn that Pascal, Jose and Ilona all provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York. Thank you for your time, and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests.

We booked through hotels.com. When we got to the hotel, it seemed to be taking a long time for the manager, Angel Torres, to check us in. Turns out they were updating their fire code system and all the reservations for rooms with king size beds were being taken out of commission for any reservation that was longer than two nights. He tried to override the computer, but it seems computers are now running the world. He very politely inquired if we would mind a room with 2 beds. I couldn't really understand why anyone would really consider that a big deal, since now I had a bed to throw all my clothes on and another one to sleep in. Once he assured me that the room was the same size as the king I told him to go ahead and do it. He then proceeded to comp us the shuttle (which runs 22/day per room) for our entire stay, as well as giving us coupons for complimentary drinks at the hotel bar. I asked him to also give us free parking to which he responded that he had, the previous week, reversed their policy of charging for parking. I told him to make sure to put that on the website because that could be major deterrence for some people. What more could one ask for!! We definitely came out ahead and he was so apologetic about the whole thing. The room was huge, clean and comfortable. The pool is lovely, the FREE breakfast had a huge variety of items to choose from. No question we would definitely stay here again and will strongly recommend it to any friends who might choose Key West as their destination.Donna, the concierge was also great. Gave great recommendations and lots of coupons for stuff on Duval Street.Thank you for choosing the Fairfield Inn Suites at The Keys Collection for your recent travels to Key West. Commitment to service and guest satisfaction is a main focus and we are delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay.	5.0

Bad: We parked our car in the hotel parking and the second day we realized that somebody had broken in. Somehow we didn't find Las Vegas a safe place to travel.

There were dead bugs on the floor of the bathroom and carpet. There was dog fur or some sort of animal fur on the furniture. There was a cigarette burn on the sheets. The room smelled like mold. The comforter smelled bad. I didn't see any bed bugs but I was paranoid about it all night. The bed was lumpy and felt like it was going to tip off of the platform. I could not believe I paid 100 to stay in this room for a night, but everything was sold out.	1.0
The facility was very clean and comfortable, but if you're traveling with a pet this might not be the place for you.

This is an older Embassy Suites that has been very well maintined and updated. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We were there for 6 days and they did everything to make sure our stay was pleasurable. The restaurant is a great place to eat if you are too tired to venture out for dinner. The front desk has a great local restaurant list and the hotel van will drop you off and pick you up when you are finished eating. We loved the daily breakfast buffet and the evening manager's reception. The hotel is located about a block from the metro station. We enjoyed the daily walk to the station and found it very easy to get to all the sites we were they to see via the metro.	5.0
Great location about three blocks from Bourbon St. Very friendly staff. I would staff there again. If you take a car remember it cost 40/day to park here, but it cost that to park anywhere in New Orleans.You got it!! Parking is at a premium here in the city but our valet team is first in class and will be sure to take care of you. Thank you for staying, we hope you return again soon.

We rested here for the night on New Years Eve. It was a easy find and had affordable rates. Can't complain about the room for the price. The bathroom was a bit small and the double queen beds wasn't the biggest, but it was a comfortable place to spend NYE with the family.	4.0
Affordable, clean, comfortable and friendly. Was surprised, for the price I paid to stay. I had expected a whole lot worse. Close to every thing in town. I had hot water and had no problems brushing my teeth. I don't believe it is plastic on the mattresses but is a mattress protector. I have seen the results of bed bugs... More	3.0
the Ramada is a great place to stay away from home. I travel for work and need a clean and affordable place to sleep. I bring my wife when we come to Naples because of the clean and quiet settings .. I will always stay here when I come for work or relaxation. Karl the Chairman 561-596-5165	5.0
We are midway through our week at the Inn. We are enjoying our stay. We chose gulf front and have not been disappointed.

Stayed here for an overnight on way home. Susan at front desk was friendly and accomodating during checkin. Room, pillows, bed, wi-fi was very good. Arrived and departed in darkness therefore cannot comment on surrounding properties. Morning breakfast was typical, grab and go. I did not use any other facilities or dine at nearby establishments.	5.0
This is the second time that we've stayed in this hotel. The rooms are clean, check in/ check out was a breeze the continental breakfast wasn't bad either. I like that the hotel is secluded but the mall restaurants are less than 5 minutes away. Pretty good for a last minute find. Darn those airplanes though..... :-)	4.0
Breakfast wasn't te best but beside that everything else was perfect. They supplied us with an extra crib and crib sheet. Help with any question we had and the staff was extremely generous.	5.0
Bad: I can't think of anything. Good: The hotel was less than 1/2 mile to the strip (an easy 10 minute walk), which allowed me to be close enough to take advantage of it, but far enough removed to get away from the mega-ness of it. Check-in was easy, the staff was friendly and helpful, the size of the room was pretty standard (which is all I wanted or needed), the bathroom was clean and well-appointed, and the bed was comfortable.	5.0
Upon arriving at the hotel, the check in process was really easy. We were given these memory card/stick things as keys. Opening the door was loud as when your key was accepted it beeped. Once in the room, we found the rooms very dated. The bathroom was tiny, couldn't close the door to the shower/toilet area if you were sitting... More	3.0
We stayed here for the Flying Pig Marathon Weekend. The hotel location is great, but the room had issues. The windows leaked terribly and we had a rain storm.

Bad: no breakfast facilities and some incompetent staff. Good: nice location and simple business hotel type	3.0
Stayed for one night on a business trip. It was worth 60 a night with tax on a Friday, Very minimum small room. Looks renovated but the bathroom needs a lot of work! No wifi even though the front desk gave me a password it don't even work! The area is pretty sketchy not the best around!!! Summer is probably a little better. Breakfast was just coffee and one muffin.... Everything is small here I suggest to stay at a casino hotel next time.	3.0
We stayed for 3 nights and had a room with a great view of the strip on the 25th floor. Rooms are lovely with a tablet to control all functions. Everything is pricey here but that's to be expected from the strip!	5.0
We had a terrific view of the ocean and beach. The room was big, the beds and pillows was comfortable. The only problem was the fan in the shower/toilet room was extremely noisy, the toilet was too close to the toilet paper dispenser and there wasn't enough counter space for our toiletry items. We had to leave most things in our toiletry bags and use the items from them. Otherwise, the room was great and it was nice to hear the roar of the ocean every night. All staff was very friendly however we were told that there would be a concierge who would sell us tickets for the whale cruise but we never saw a concierge for the 2 days that we were there. We went directly to the cruise ticket office instead. We will probably stay there again if we go back to Virginia Beach.	4.0

As Christian I found this hotel inappropriate because of what I think were sexually suggestive photos and art work. I would not recommend this hotel for families with children because of the photos and Artwork. Hi Delia, our intention is never to offend anyone. One of our values is community and in that we are inclusive of people of all walks of life. We curate all local art from local artists to support our local community but also to support different values and showcase different views from everyone. We certainly understand that not everyone will enjoy or understand the art, but we thank you for giving us a try. Just as any other contemporary museum, we showcase art that reflects the life and times of the artists we represent here as an art hotel. We do have families who stay here and enjoy it as a learning experience and we hope to continue to provide that for our guests and local community.	3.0
Very outdated rooms. Beds are hard as a rock. Continental breakfast suitable for the carb lovers, but nothing for the health conscious.

Joseph's service made our trip! He accommodated all of our requests and even went above and beyond to make our trip as nice as possible!

Stayed here 2 nights. Rooms were large and spotless. Full breakbast included - even made-to-order omelettes and eggs. We didn't use the pool but there were lots of families there who did. Strong smell of chlorine in the lobby though the first night.	5.0
Stayed there with the kids (6 of us total). Room was spacious and pull out couch was wonderful. Nice kitchen type area with frig and sink. Would choose again.	5.0
If it wasn't for the carpets, this would have been a decent place to stay carpets are chemically sprayed on and it adds an irritating smell to the room-watch out for people with respiratory issues.

I stay at a lot of different Marriott properties and this Courtyard was one of the nicest of the Courtyard brand i've stayed at. It has a big lobby with plenty of seating and a dining area for the Bistro that is very nice. The front desk staff was as usual very friendly and accommodating. They had a room ready for me at 10am when I checked in. Starbucks coffee is served at the Bistro and they have a nice food menu as well. The room was immaculate and the bed was comfortable. Air conditioning was nice and cold. The view of the lake was excellent. I happen to be in Seattle on some beautiful weather days. Clear skies and no humidity. If your doing business downtown and need to see Amazon this hotel is a 6 Uber ride. You could walk to some nice restaurants on the lake or take a short taxi ride for 5. I would suggest Uber from the airport as opposed to a taxi. Uber was a 39 ride and the taxi was a 50 ride.Hi Thomas,Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful experience at Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union. Much appreciated for the comments on commute fairs and the positive feedback about our hotel and staff. Thank you for staying with us and we hope you see you again on your next visit to Seattle.Sincerely,Dan PhamGuest Service Representative	5.0

Went here with the family in June of 2011. It's a beautiful hotel with lots of nice touches in the rooms: AC, ceiling fans, glass accordion doors that open to the lanai, full kitchen and washer/dryer.

Not a bad place to stay but not exactly their best, either. It's easy to miss, too, because of the fact that it is nestled so close to a Ford dealer that has cars parked out along Rte. 19.

We just want to thank you for the wonderful service we received at Best Western Plus Encino while visiting our mother at Cottage Hospital.

The Best Western Old Mill has been renovated and looks much nicer than previous years. The rooms were nice and clean, but were very small and crowded with furniture.

I recently stayed at the Days Inn in Glen Burnie and I really appreciated its location in relationship to the airport (BWI) and shopping malls, which was the intent of my trip. The staff was great the facility was above my expectation and I would recommend this hotel to anyone just looking for a place to lay your head.	5.0
Our experience was near perfect - clean room and facility friendly helpful staff, Dog friendly with NO FEE, upgrade breakfast menu, just off I-295 so minutes from all major vacation or business locations all for half what you would pay for same elsewhere	5.0
The hotel was apparently renovated about 10 or 15 years ago, but hasn't been very well maintained since then. The condition of the rooms is clean but run-down. The attached restaurant serves pretty decent Indian food. The biggest complaint is that there was a plumbing issue with the hot water not running in the shower. The second is that the check in process was excruciatingly slow. I don't know if I'd stay there again, given the plethora of other inexpensive hotels in the area. If you do stay there, check all of the amenities in the room and insist on a different room if something doesn't work.	3.0
Stayed two nights. Very noisy next door till after 11 each night. Ask if I could be moved. Was told when reported the next morning after the first night, that I should have called the Front Desk.

Room smelled like cigarette smoke. Bunch of guys from another room having a party, being rowdy and getting drunk in parking lot right near office until 3AM. Clerk did nothing to quiet them down, call the police, etc. I was a little concerned when door to office locked at night and saw a sign for weekly rates. I will no longer stay in motels with outside doors. Accommodations would not have been terrible but I guess when room is too cheap, maybe doesn't attract best crowd.	1.0
On a two day layover to see my grandkids I stayed here in one of the King suites. I had originally booked a different cheaper hotel (Country Inn) but when I walked in to check on the rooms I decided to look for something else that also had an indoor pool since the CI suites had no window in the Living area. The space there was also very small. I am so glad that I then found the Drury Inn!! The atmosphere in the hotel was perfect for us. Friendly staff!! Yes the rooms were older but they are well equipped, very large and very comfortable. They are not at all nasty in any way so I do not understand the complaints from others. For the price you just cannot beat this hotel!! Lots of food - breakfast with lots of choices, snack in the afternoon (popcorn and free soda) and a food bar in the evening including FREE drinks. Simple foods but VERY acceptable! WE ALL HAD A FUN TIME HERE. The tween grandids really enjoyed the HEATED POOL. This was also a convenient enough location to make a midday trip to the fabulous Aquarium too. We did have a problem with our neighbor smoking in their room although this is clearly stated on signes throughout the hotel that this is a NON SMOKING HOTEL . Since the vents are connected in the rooms we were smelling the smoke. Both the grandkids are allergic to smoke and it really hurts my sinuses too. The staff moved us to our choice of a new room (not sure why the exhaust vents in hotels are now connected but just saw that in a Hilton I stayed in recently too). I will certainly stay here again on a quick layover to Atlanta. + FREE PARKING and FREE WIFI too!	4.0

This was our first time staying at a LaQuinta and it won't be our last. We travel across the United States twice a year from Florida to BC, Canada and we will be staying at LaQuinta more. They are pet friendly, have nice clean rooms, the staff is wonderful and the breakfast is Great.	5.0
In addition to having to ask to be moved three times after seeing the initial condition of the room I was assigned (something I have never done in nearly 100 hotels I have stayed at), they carpet was so dirty I refused to take off my socks, the nightstand had a sticky substance on the surface and in the drawers, the furniture was old, worn and dirty, the staff was not terribly helpful and the neighborhood is in an economically depressed area and I did not feel completely safe at night being a single woman travelling alone. There are multiple signs in the parking lot warning that the hotel is not responsible for any damage or theft and I was worried about my car being broken into. Only pros- just off the highway and one of the nicest hotel gyms I've ever seen. Even so, I will NEVER stay here again! If I hadn't already paid in advance through hotels.com, I would have left immediately.	2.0
This hotel met all of expectations. Great breakfast, good value and convenient location.	5.0
A nice place to stay. I would recommend changing the breakfast menu (it was dried out, pretty tasteless, except for the waffles). One of the 2 elevators was broken, so you had to walk all the way to the other end of the hotel, go to your floor, then walk all tbe way back to your room. The staff, however, are top notch. Going to DC they have a shuttle to the metro. Good value for the price.	3.0

I arrived a little earlier being I had been driving all night. I was ready to check into my room, but I had forgot that check-in time was at 3pm. I ask the desk clerk would it be ok if I could sit and wait the next 3 hrs in the lobby and she said yes. Well I guess she saw how tired I looked, she was nice enough to check with housekeeping to see if a room was ready. She allowed me to check in early and I am very grateful to her. Well I also want to commend the staff name Andre who were very helpful to make sure my stay at the hotel was satisfactory! Breakfast was stock when I went down and I was very please with the staff professionalism. I always stay at this hotel when I am in Suffolk, Va. Great Job	4.0

This hotel is on a well-known avenue and literally across Lake Union. You can see from your hotel room window all of the lake tours available and boats to rent. So many people walking, jogging, and biking around the lake. Make sure you go for a lake view room. Just down the street there are some good places to eat like a BBQ place and Art Mable 21 restaurant. The staff is the best, very helpful and friendly. What I enjoyed the most was their breakfast Acai bowl, so good and an energy boost to start the day right. WiFi is always free and I had no issues.Dear EndyBOSTON,Thank you for sharing your feedback! I am glad to hear that you enjoyed your time at our hotel with the surrounding area being active and upbeat, matching the mood and view of the beautiful Lake Union. The Bistro's Acai Bowls are the best and I'm happy you had a chance to enjoy them at the top of your morning here. We pride ourselves with our staff service and hospitality, so knowing that we were able to take care of our loyal guests, like you, is an absolute delight! Can't wait to have you staying with us again whenever your travels bring you back to Seattle.In hospitality,Alina C.	4.0

No need to look anywhere else when staying in Louisville! For the price, proximity to YUM Center and the beautiful views of the river, it's the best deal going!

Close to port and airport. Next door is a McDonalds. Rooms are clean. Not recommended for a vacation place. You can drive to the restaurants, beach and shops . They cater to the pre and post cruisers and flyers. We had to catch a plane at 7am. and it was great for that. Thats about it.	3.0
The shuttle service was very convenient for concert goers, although the late return must have irritated to driver. He ran red lights, speedings, a little reckless. The hotel could use a coffee shop in the afternoons there only the bar open. It was a good location, Crown Center a block away. The Sheraton needs to get their name on the directories at the Crown Center to find the walkway.	4.0
Brand new hotel in brand new retail area on the water. Easy to access off the beltway. Friendly staff, clean rooms, comfortable beds. Only complaint is that the full offering of the Hampton Inn breakfast was not available at the two times we came down (at 7am and 9am on a Saturday). The food at 9am had been in the bin too long. Still more choices than the continental breakfast at other places, including make-you-own waffles and yummy egg burritos. The fee for parking in the community garage was free with room key and even included a convenient room key drop upon final exit. Pool but no hot tub.	4.0

The best part of this hotel is the location. It's within walking distance of everything. The breakfast was severely lacking and crowded, but we'd rather go out and eat at the local places anyway.

The hotel is not bad. Staff is friendly. We have stayed at several times. This year we purchased park and fly package and left our car there while away on vacation. We returned to the hotel to find the vehicle had been broken into. The driver's side window had been shattered and someone tried to rip the door handle off. The hotel did cover the hole. We had to find a vacumn and vacumn the vehicle. Hotel did not offer. Had to drive 5 hours home without window through cold temperatures and some rain. They did call the police department. They came out took pictures etc. hotel apologized and refunded our room for the one night park and fly. Needless to say we will not be staying here again. We appreciate hearing from our guests and thank you for your feedback. We were very disappointed to hear your car was broken into while in our gated parking lot and understand how frustrating this is. Unfortunately, there has been a recent wave of car break-ins around the airport, affecting a number of hotels in the area. In the case of a car break-in, we contact and hand over to the local police department for further investigation. Fortunately with the help of local police and third party security monitoring our parking lot, we have been able to stop the vandalism. We work diligently to create a safe environment for our guests and will continue to work with local police to ensure our hotel, parking lot and city are safe. We offer our sincerest apologies and are glad we had a chance to discuss the situation with you directly. If you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know and we are happy to be of assistance.	1.0
Excellent location and very comfortable accommodations. Trader Joes was only a couple of blocks away, so it was easy to pick up a few staples for breakfast. This unit had a very efficient use of space for a family of four (two young adults). Plenty of good restaurants within walking distance. Definitely recommend this place, but we never answered the phone because we read the warnings about time share pestering.	5.0

This is a very economical motel, great location, great service, clean (although floors could have been a little cleaner but it's tiles with sandy environment so ....), and free parking. Close to many restaurants and pubs, and beach. I would def stay here again for the price point (if you are not looking for a fancy hotel type)	5.0
Bad: One of the room maids kept forgetting to leave sufficient quantities of basic toiletries and the quality of bathroom cleaning could have been better. Good: Very friendly receptionist personnel, special thanks to Jesse! Nice view to the Library, added to the room booking for free. Plenty of varied places to eat out within a few mins walk from the hotel, catering for all choices.	4.0
SUPER NICE HOTEL!! Highly recommend it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Super friendly staff, rooms are really really clean, delicious hot and cold breakfast items (complimentary) and are replenished the entire time, so you don't get left with the scraps if your running late, 24/7 hot fresh coffee in the lobby, and they even have yummy fresh cookies on the front desk to grab after a long day at the job. It's the small things, like the receptacle outlets located ABOVE the nightstand so you don't have to do furniture reconfigurations to plug in your phone! The internet stays on. Yea, it really stay on all the time with no unexpected drops. Also, the TV is real TV....not the Hotel-Guided limited channel system. So, believe me when I say this is a nice hotel. It really is. ) It's safe....quit looking.....book, now.	5.0
The hotel staff makes you feel welcome. The rooms were clean and fresh.

Great breakfast buffet each morning. Definitely adds value to the price. But otherwise, not a great stay. I think their cleaning crew must be understaffed. One day they didn't take out our trash or give us bath rugs or hand towels. The six of us in a two bedroom suite shared towels and used a washcloth -- a washcloth! -- for a rug. The next day we didn't get any maid service at all! At 6:00 pm, we went downstairs and asked for our own towels. The little market store downstairs was sold out of bottled water for two of our five day stay. Not having water after a long day of city walking was a real disappointment. And there is no easy market or store within walking distance, so we were chugging tap water. Yuck. My son got sick one night, so we hoped for ginger ale or Sprite or something to settle his stomach. Nope. All they had was Mountain Dew.The location across from Lake Union was pretty, but not convenient for downtown activities. We had to wait up to 20 minutes for an Uber driver during peak hours. That was poor planning on my part to book here, but I had no idea that Uber would be so difficult. Despite the challenges, we did have a decent stay. Our two room suite was spacious and comfortable. And again, the breakfast was really fantastic.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your recent stay with us and providing your honest feedback. On behalf of our team, I apologize we fell short of meeting our expectations but most importantly yours. It is guest as yourself who help improve our hotel and provide better service in the future.

A perfect location for a weekend excursion from NYC. This hotel is approximately 20 mins from two NY wineries one being the Brotherhood Winery which is the oldest in the USA.

Our stay at the Holiday Inn Express was fine. The room was clean and neat, the staff friendly and helpful.

The place looked promising from the approach its right on the river, facing the beautiful River North area. The building, built way back when, is charming from the outside. And the lobby, while not grand, is also appealing. Once I got into my room, though ho hum.It isnt terrible, but there just is not one thing about it that makes it the least bit special. I had a small room, which was fine, but it was just very bland. The bed covering is one of those bad synthetic things, there were only two limp pillows on the bed stuff like that. There wasnt even an iron or board in the room. The place just felt very cheap and kind of sad. My rate was 200, which was less than other properties the weekend I stayed. But in retrospect, I should have paid an extra 30 to stay at a place that felt more upbeat. My only plusses were: its location, the fact that I was able to check in early, and free internet. Those arent strong enough factors, though next time Im in Chicago, Ill stay somewhere else. C-minus.	3.0
This hotel needs a better ventilation system!! The whole place smelled of smoke and farts. I found the casino to be very dreary and outdated. The rooms were very clean and we had a nice view. We had breakfast there and the smell of smoke permeated the restaurant so bad it was hard to eat. I wouldn't stay here again, for sure.	2.0
I stayed at the hotel three nights. I was very disappointed by the level of noise at night. The doors were EXTREMLY loud. I could not get to sleep my second night there because I heard doors shut the entire night. I was on the 25th floor. In addition to the noise, the hotel somehow lost my reservation in their system and I had to escalate the issue all the way up to management to get it resolved. It wasn't easy. I will never stay at a Club Quarters hotel again.	1.0

Hotel was under construction and smelled bad and was very messy. On top of that the staff was bad. We were in a rush and needed a cab to get to an event. We told the man at the desk to call a cab when we checked in. When we came down later he hadn't gotten a cab for us, so we asked him to call the cab again. After sitting in the lobby for 15 minutes waiting, we asked when our cab was coming and he said he didnt know we still wanted a cab and would call. Eventually 25 minutes later a cab dropped someone off at the hotel and we were able to take that cab.	2.0

Nice hotel with clean rooms but a very odd location off the Interstate. The staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was not protected from the abundance of highway noise throughout the night. Additionally, it's not extremely intuitive on how to actually get to the hotel through a very weird access road. And, we thought the parking was limited especially... More	3.0
We stayed at the Allatoona Inn's lake home. We were very disappointed that the house was quite a walk from the lake, not on the lake, as advertised. The lake is beautiful but we were not able to use it as not all of the people in our group could make the walk to the beach. The house, although cute,... More	2.0

The hotel was good, not great. I didn't feel pampered - but I was comfortable (I think it supposed to be a 4 star hotel). The nice thing is that its close to the shopping mall which has a grocery store on the lower level! The mall also has a great food court also you can easily stock your room. The hotel staff was very nice and accommodating. I would stay here again. However!!!! Get rid of the 7.00 charge to use the sauna, it's ridiculous moreover, they can't possibly be making any 'real' profit off of a 7.00 dollar charge.	4.0
My room or hallway didnt smell funny, the staff was friendly helpful, and there wasn't any loud noises or unruly guests. I had hotwater and the heater worked. As far as the room itself, you get what you pay for..No hangers, old furniture poor tv reception/wifi. The bed was comfortable enough. If you just need a place to crash or need to save this place works. Things that made me giggle: the phone in the room was from the Marriot in another state, the sheet that had the list of tv channels had a different hotel name on it, the advertisement for a pizza place that will deliver to your room has relocated and no longer does the keycard does not have the Inn's name on it but does have another pizza advertisement (different place) all over it again says they will deliver to your room, ya, no its out of the area.	3.0
I have stayed at this hotel for the past several years and find it to be well kept and clean. Staff are friendly and accommodating. It is located in a quiet part of town though remains close to a major road for easy access. Would recommend this location to others.	4.0

My boyfriend and I stayed here based on the reviews on this site, which I can usually depend on--and again, they were right!The hotel is very nice inside, the location is prime, and the staff is one of the Best we have ever encountered, and I have travelled worldwide. The rooms are smaller, but if you think about it, what is missing is the vast expanse between the side of the bed and the main window, and who uses that Anyway!Great things that made up for the smaller size (and my boyfriend is 6'2 and had No problem with the hotel at all!)are the small kitchenette, with coffee maker and supplies for morning java, the bathroom and it's nice shower, and the bed was very comfortable! Ask for a room higher up and enjoy the great view! We were not disturbed by any noises, nor elevator troubles, in the least. There is also a nice desk in the room, for your laptop. Once more, the staff here will do everything in their power to make your stay wonderful!We Will be going back ,and we will be staying at CQ! There is also a small cafe in front of the hotel that had a very good breakfast, and looked busy at night with casual cocktails and Italian food that looked great.Remember that you are not moving in for good, and once you get in the room, you will find you have all the space you need!	4.0

We stayed here for three nights whilst visiting Busch gardens. Upgraded to a room on the 11th floor for only 30/night. The views were amazing.

This hotel was really good. The desk lady was very nice when we arrived, the room was clean, parking was right in front of our room.

Great family find. Staff was great! Pool kept kids busy. Eating area is welcoming. Close to all camps in NH and they are very tolerant of kid behavior. Right of highway 89. Nice drive into Concord, the State Capital and good ice cream. And The Candy Shoppe!	5.0
Bad: Nothing, I cherished my stay here. Good: This is a gorgeous little hotel on ocean drive, 200 yards from the busy beach front, just far enough for it to be quiet through the night, the veiw from the rooftop pool was exquisite, the rooms and the restaurant were also of the highest standard. Loved it	5.0
I was so happy with this gem we stayed for a week.the owners, Pete and Kelly are so wonderful and personable. I will be looking forward to seeing them every winter. I highly recommend this quaint hotel, great value for your money.	5.0

We stayed at the Comfort Inn for two nights over Labor Day weekend. Pros The rooms are large . The beds are comfortable. The windows open to allow the fresh cool air in. This was a huge plus!

Small town on the state route - unexpected delight with hotel room. Comfortable, clean and incredibly gorgeous view of the beach, water, sun. Nice to also have the picnic tables, hot tub. Access to town a breeze (because the town is so small). Parking is easy. Easy to find	5.0
Bad: The property tries so hard to be trendy that it actually made it very difficult to stay as a family. There was only one pillow each, three towels for four people and a tightly restricted supply of coffee- only two, environmentally unfriendly, pods. The oddest part was there were no teaspoons, only stirrers and amazingly no kettle- and only two mugs for four people. We had to bother house keeping just to bring a kettle up to make tea (also not supplied). This hotel sells trendy box water for 8 which pretty much sums up how far off the mark this place is with practicalities. Trendy sure, but practical and sensible...no. Reminded me of of a start up thats well funded but just silly. Also the rooms air conditioning setting included jet engine or off so that was extremely uncomfortable. I wouldnt stay here again given they also have an odd naughty drawer and I needed to explain to my 7 year old what sex dust was. Extremely odd place to stay as a family. Good: I liked that the lobby was filled with fun games and a great bar which was very relaxed and welcoming.	2.0
Perfect for pets, nice pool	4.0
Nice staff. Good breakfast. Good TV for at night. Only negative is I did not like the type of pillows they had. I like one larger pillow. They had many small pillows.

Clean hotel, with exceptional staff. I would have given this hotel the highest rating, but unfortunately, they decided to put low flow shower heads in the rooms. My room, and other rooms, reported by friends who stayed here last weekend, all had the same complaint. They could barely rinse the shampoo out of their hair. It was that bad.	4.0

they were able to accommodate us with a feather free room. the door men were especially friendly and remembered us!	5.0
Hotel and room were very clean. I didn't need any extraordinary service but the staff was friendly and helpful during check-in and check out although they were a little slow and there was a ~5 min line for both. Free breakfast was the usual for a holiday inn express, which is pretty good as far as free breakfasts go. I walked from the hotel to Hominy Grill for dinner (.6 miles) and to MUSC for an interview. You are pretty close by but you have to cross multiple busy streets without a crosswalk or traffic light so it would not be walkable for everyone. Parking is free and the lot seems adequately big.	4.0
Good: i enjoyed the design, decoration and layout of the room	4.0
Was a great 1 night stay. Lobby was beautiful, very clean, nice personable staff. Rooms were very nice! Wish they had an option for a room w a King bed and a sofa bed, we needed to get the rollaway, which was ok, but only sleeps 1. Pool was nice, kids enjoyed for a bit. Breakfast buffet was great! Would definitely stay here again and recommend to those looking for a nice place to stay.	5.0

Not great - Construction is important but changing the lobby is not the most important reason. Rooms are more important. I would skip this Hotel until the construction is finished. I was not impressed to stay here.	2.0
The only good thing about this hotel is the proximity to Kings Dominion. I will be driving to the park next time. The hotel is right next to the highway, which for me is a security concern. The staff was not overly friendly. The room is a bed and shower, not overly nice, or clean. If you are looking for a place to sleep and shower only (not your most comfortable stay) OR cannot afford a nicer hotel this is the place for you. Although the attached Denny's is convenient, it is dirty and we were served cold food. Hope this helps make your decision.	2.0
The room was nice and clean. The only downsides were the A/C system and location. The A/C system was very loud and did not cool the room adequately. The location was right next to the freeway onramp (noisy) and the neighborhood was sketchy. I will not stay here again.	2.0
Very nice hotel, friendly staff, convenient to the airport. We stayed here during an NFL football game and I couldn't be happier.

The hotel stay was great. Stayed for a conference located at the hotel which was great as well. The only complaint I have is the parking. You can park in their parking garage connected to the hotel for a $16 charge, which is a little ridiculous. The hotel was good at compensating me for this as I was uninformed and unaware, but the third party company that rubs the toll through the garage was absolutely horrid!!! I was I could give negative reviews on them alone they one young lady in particular made my great weekend end in absolute anger while leaving. Tried to charge me almost $40 in charges for parking with the receipt from the hotel, staying that they had covered it for me.	3.0

Hands down definitely the worst Best Western I've stayed!!! Don't know if previous people or cleaning person left balcony door open But the room had at least 5 mosquitoes buzzing around, fortunately I managed to get 3. A slight musty odor like a old wet towel throughout room. Luckily we only stayed 1 night if it weren't for the ocean view we would have literately fought for money back!

We have now visited Bricktown Hotel on several occasions. The service has always been friendly, the shuttle is prompt and service oriented. As a family, we have enjoyed the pool.

I went to Chicago last weekend for the Ryder Cup (Golf Tournament) and everywhere I usually stay was completely booked! Rooms were going for crazy rates, so I started seeking out some options that were 'off the beaten path'. I discovered the Central Loop Hotel, and I knew where it was, as I used to walk by it from time to time when I still lived in Chicago.The hotel is very well kept, and has cheap valet (34/night with in-and-out access!). THe check in process was a little strange to me because you check in using a machine like you would at the airport. Some people might love this - but i missed talking to a real person. The machine printed my room info and key card and I headed up to my 6th floor corner room.This room was perfect for my needs. Very comfortable bed, sparkling white linens, beautiful widows that overlooked some fantastic Chicago architecture (post office). But - this room was TINY! Again, it was just me and I knew I would only be spending time in my room sleeping, but the bathroom was very small (no tub, shower only) and the closet was tiny. Almost felt like a ship's quarters. If you are going as a couple, or even attempting to bring kids I would def. upgrade to a larger room or suite. The rooms have free wifi (yeah!), lots of cable channels, free in room coffee and a friendly concierge staff. Free bottled water stations on each floor are also a nice touch.I will stay here again if I'm traveling alone.	4.0
The overall building is clean but showing some signs of wear...The front desk staff are very friendly, polite and helpful. Its in a safe area and there is a nice big mall a block down the street. There is a free shuttle that brings you right to the Springfield metro subway station. The breakfast spot next door is not an award winner, but hey it's included so don't complain. The only thing we didn't like is that some families hung out in the halls late at night chit chatting loudly. I guess it was our misfortune that night and the other thing was that the cleaning staff started vacuuming the halls like at 7 am in the morning and it wakes you up...other than that its okay for a short stay.	3.0
The room was a little small but was right on the beach with a large balcony. It had a fridge and a microwave. The non oceanfront rooms are across the street as is the outdoor pool and additional parking. The free breakfast was good and open until 10:00. Everything was clean!	5.0

I've stayed at this location on several occasions but I must say this visit did not rate anywhere near my previous stays. The water in the tub backed up which is gross and unsanitary. The surface in the tub is very slippery which should have better surfacing inside the tub. These experiences has caused me to seek future overnight/weekend stays at other 4 or 5 star hotels in the surrounding area. We went for coffee in the breakfast area, but the coffee seemed to have included undesired coffee grinds, we then chose to go out for breakfast after notifying the staff.	1.0
This was a stop over on a cross country driving trip. We had high hopes for this place and were hoping we would like it enough to stay two nights. One night was more than enough. Upon check in we were directed to a suite that required us to go down a floor from the lobby. Got there and felt... More	3.0
We enjoyed a great stay at La Quinta and would stay here again for the value and proximity to the fwy! Overall, a great value for the price!! Good sized guestroom and bathroom. It was clean and quiet. And we enjoyed the variety of breakfast item's that were served buffet style!!	4.0

Me and my 3 girlfriends went here.

I had high hopes for this hotel. Yes, it is a 2 star but others give it a good rating. So I thoght this would be a good place to stay. When we first arrived at around 330 pm, the outside of the hotel was well kept so things looked promising. The lobby was clean and smelled nice. When I went to check in there was first a delay because the customer in front of me room was not ready. Then I found out my room wasn't ready. I was asked to leave my so they could call me when it was. They suggested I go drive around until then with gas prices so high. We came back at 5 pm and the room still wasn't ready. We sat in the hot car for another hour before they finally just offered us two single rooms instead of the queen double we prepaid for, stating they sold out of those rooms. We lost a whole day of our vacation simply b/c we weren't able to check-in until nearly 4 hours after the stated time. We didnt get to the beach until late so my kids only got tospend about an hour in the water. Check-out was no better. It was supposed to be at noon, but a male housekeeper came into my room at 1130 without knocking ready to turn the room over. Luckily I wasn't indisposed or anything. Then, the front desk tried to charge me a second time for the room. The room was nice, however. I would have considered staying thre again if those things didn't happen.	3.0
Had a wonderful stay here. My fiancee and I came for a weekend getaway. The staff was really helpful, the hotel is immaculate, the spa is a blast, and in the best part of Portland. We will definitely be back.	5.0

We have stayed in many condos and resorts across Maui. We wanted to add a few nights on a budget and this place was perfect. The rooms are really small but they have them very organized. The staff was very friendly and it never seemed as if we were bothering them.	4.0
Decent for the price, my room didn't have a microwave. I inquired about that at checkout, and was told to make sure to ask when I make my reservation. This stay I was on the end of the building away from the railroad tracks, thus giving more restful sleep. Overall good stay.	4.0
Great stay would definitely stay here again	4.0
The woman who checked us in upon our arrival was incredibly rude and immediately put a damper on stay. I'm not sure if we were given a handicapped room or if they are all similar, but the bathroom didn't have a tub and was absolutely disgusting. It was one big room with a drain in the floor and did not appear to have been cleaned in some time. One corner appeared to have blood. At 5 a.m. A group of workers with coolers stood at the end of the other hallway from us and we're speaking so loudly for over 10 minutes it woke up my husband, my infant, and I. As my in laws have recently moved to the area I expect we will be visiting Tracy frequently but I will NEVER again stay at this hotel.	2.0
The hotel and staff were great! There is a lot of construction in the area, so that made it hard to see the hotel as well as arriving/leaving due to traffic.	5.0
With the movie theater, kids babysitter facility,bowling alley, swimming pool, casino, etc this was a very nice place, only 15 minutes from the strip. kid friendly swimming pool (which also had a pretty lively weeklly adult pool party) was nice. large clean rooms accomodated 4 people easily. the st tropez buffet food was very good and moderately pricedwe would definitely stay there again. a large shopping mall and other stores are less than 5 minutes away. beatiful view of both the strip at night and the mountains from our room. we also looked out over the pool area and a golf coursethe fitness center was just that. not a bike and treadmill like some places. they had treadmills, elliptical trainers and bikes as well as several weight machinesspa on site but i didnt get to try it out unfortunatelygive it a try and i know you wont be disappointed	5.0

We had a very positive experience at this hotel. Our party (2 adults, 2 teenagers) had plenty of room to spread out. We had a pull-out sofa sleeper, roll-away bed, kitchenette, and queen-sz. bed. There was a large dressing area off the bathroom, a great place for suitcases, etc. The furniture was contemporary and new, beds were very comfortable. This hotel is very close to Arlington Cemetery, and the Rosslyn Metro stop was a five minute walk away. They also have a shuttle to the metro. The people at the desk were very responsive to all our needs.	5.0

Stayed here from October 12-18th. Excellent location, away from the hustle and bustle of the strip traffic. Great eating places around, shopping for ones who like to shop. One the greatest bingo halls ever. I came her in April and won 46,080.00 playing bingo, came back this time and my husband won 1430.00 playing bingo and then won another 500.00 when they called his name on a raffle drawing.Rooms are to die for, absolutely beautiful, had a wonderful view of the city, mountains and golf course. Next door also in two other casinos to enjoy, and 5minutes away is the beautiful Red Rock Casino.The slots are also nice to play, did not win a lot, but stayed alive and did not lose my shirt.Will definitely be coming back to stay.	5.0

Staff were very friendly in general. Breakfast had a good selection. Rooms were kept clean and towels provided daily. We noticed a lot of school parties stay here and that some people hung out in the hallways which generated some noise. We were not impressed that 2 nights in a row we had to evacuate at around midnight taking our sleeping son out of his crib/cot. Lounge was not open through the week only on a Friday and Saturday - depending where you stay in hotel you may hear some noise. We arrived on a Friday night and there was a function on we had to park far away but there is plenty of parking available. Our room had a Refrigerator, microwave, Iron plus board. There was a slight concern for us as we were told that there may be no cribs left but thankfully we did get one. We were disappointed that the swimming pool was only open 6pm-10pm Mon-Fri and on Saturday and Sunday's it was 2pm-10pm. There is a small shop in foyer where you can buy essentials and various other items and there is also a computer and printer in this area too.	4.0
Great stay with a few minor discomforts The toilet stopped working and they sent up a maintenance worker with a plunger for us. we tried to plunge it but it didn't work. Went to the service desk the next morning but our request for help wasn't recorded and we had to submit another request. Maintenance worker came up and fixed the clog but before anyone fixed it my family had to go to the restroom near the lobby. On another note, Breakfast was great and kitchen staff was welcoming.	4.0
This is an excellent location, priced right. Best of all was the staff, especially Stephanie! She assisted the family with room needs and was extremely professional and courteous.

The hotel was generally clean, well maintained, comfortable beds, towels at poolside, breakfast buffet reasonably stocked. However, there were a couple of problems with our room. We stayed in room 120 for two nights. First, when we entered the room we were all struck by a kind of damp feeling and ammonia smell. I thought it was just cleaning fluid and our noses did adjust in a few minutes. However, upon reentering the room each time the smell was always there and did not go away. Additionally, paper left in the room got that kind of damp feel about it where it goes a little limp, and wet clothes hung up upon our arrival were still damp two days later, even though the air conditioner was on the whole time. Theres almost certainly water collecting somewhere in the room causing the ammonia smell and damp feeling. Its worth noting that the air conditioner was new and quiet and worked fine, and I wouldnt have suspected any problem. However, my suspicion is that it was set to recirculate or perhaps the drain was clogged, or both. I looked for a recirculate control on the A/C, but couldnt find one. Either that or theres a plumbing leak somewhere in the room, though I saw no sign of it. I reported this to the clerk on checkout. The other problem is that the tub drain was misaligned with tub floor and would not close properly, so it was impossible to take a tub bath. The clerk offered to switch our room, but it was not worth the trouble since we were checking out soon.	3.0

Greeted at check-in. Had to have an extra 25 held on my credit card in case of damages () - had to sign a No Party policy - that was a first. Room was clean and pleasant. Bed was clean and bathroom was clean. Breakfast was a bit hap-hazard in that the line was incredibly long to obtain a made-to-order omelette. Nice provisions for the breakfast. Set up was good. Food was better than I expected and they offered healthy choices for breakfast including yogurt, fresh fruit, oatmeal. I would stay again. I felt safe and the place was maintained well.	4.0

I stayed at this hotel for four nights and enjoyed my stay. The location was convienantly located next to I-95 (although somewhat hard to find the first time due to the congestion of the area) and a 5-10 minute drive to the Franconia-Springfield metro station. The free breakfast included all you can eat scrambled eggs, fried potatoes, and waffles along with the usual fare, a nice touch. The breakfast room was kept clean and well stocked by an ever present staff member. The staff was about the friendliest and most helpful of any hotel I've stayed in. My only complaints would be a weak air conditioner and noisiness in the early evening due to the large number of children staying there. Quiet overnight, though.	4.0
Had a great time, amazing place. Will definitely be returning. Did some hiking while we were there and had some great food. Great Decor and very friendly people.

I have stayed here a few times and most recently this week. Their deluxe rooms are sub par, the ones with the golf view are somewhat better and worth the money. The Mediterranean two bedroom suite is a great value and the Presidential was a swing and a miss for us. All of the rooms are spacious, but the bedding in the deluxe rooms was uncomfortable. We never stayed in the one bedroom suite, but Med suite is very large with ample common space and generous sized bedrooms. The bathrooms are green granite which gives a nice feel to the room. We most recently stayed in a Presidential suite (one of four in the hotel) room 960. We were booked in the Med. suite, but decided to accept the up-sell upgrade and pay the extra 124 per night to check it out. While it is about 1,000 sq ft larger than the Med. the huge common area was wasted on the two of us. The two bedrooms were a bit larger with the king master offering a beautiful panoramic view of the golf course from the bathroom. The rest of the room has sweeping views of the mountains, once you get past the immediate view of the top of the parking garage. The master shower has a shower panel that looks to offer a variety of body jets with a shower head. The thing was awful with the only two options being the waterfall and shower head or just the waterfall. The first night the water barely got hot enough to take a shower. I reported the problems and they fixed the water temp but not the panel. The water in LV is very hard and this panel also had the classic green deposits that come from the water. You would think they could afford some CLR to clean the unitWhile I am on the soapbox, I must comment about their toiletries. The shower/bath soap was a tiny little white bar in a cheap cardboard box. The shampoo and conditioner were equally cheap, but the kicker was the hand/face soap. It was a little round disc in a plastic package. When I opened it to use it, I thought it was a recycled soap piece! It had no lather and was just crap. If anyone from the property reads this, you really need to re-think these products as they scream CHEAP. The rest of the facility is a midstream casino/resort experience. Granted, you are not on the Strip, but there are nicer neighborhood properties in the area. The newly added The Game sports bar and Subway are decent. The Deli. offers a great value for your money albeit with a limited menu. There is also a movie theater and a variety of other restaurants that we didn't try. The pool appears to be small for the property, so investigate it further if you plan to spend much of your stay at it. The staff are all very friendly and there is ample and easy parking. Overall, not a bad place, but just OK.Thank you for posting your comments on your recent stay. I have sent your comments to our Facilities and Housekeeping teams to address. I hope the next time you stay you will take the time to enjoy all the amenities our property has to offer. Have a nice day.	3.0

Arrival experience: Clean lobby. Upon entry, front desk personnel greeted us and assisted with check in. Room (general): Overall nice-sized room and well laid out.

We stayed at this motel for 5 months. The room, although clean, spacious and relatively bug free, (saw several roaches) was not well lit, had cracks and scratches in the walls, and was noisy. We complained about the lighting several times, and also our neighbor's squeaky door without results. Finally we just gave up, and lived with it. We checked... More	2.0

This hotel is located close to I20 and has a staff that goes out of their way to please the guests.

Nothing bad to say about this hotel. Great location, great service, great staff, great rooms! And they take pets! The front desk staff was very helpful and so courteous.

The renovations in my room were very inconsistent. On the positive side, the living area and the bed room were nicely updated with modern furniture, quality curtains, and a very comfortable bed. But, the kitchenette and bathroom looked as though they hadn't been updated in decades. The cabinet doors were hanging askew, the bathroom door was in desperate need of paint, and the tub was old, stained, and yellowed. Also, I had a remote control that didn't work, a lamp that didn't work, and a drain that stopped up and spilled water into the floor. I wouldn't stay at this hotel again.	3.0
Above and beyond was where it all began. We traveled we our puppy and the staff greeted us with smiles and treated us better than family.

I was passing through town and needed to stay the night. This hotel was company approved and very inviting. The front desk clerk was welcoming to a weary traveler and the room was nice and clean. I would recommend. The Breakfest offerings were better than other hotels and the business center was clean and well stocked.	5.0
We have stayed at this Red Roof Inn a half a dozen times or more because it is convenient, clean, and comfortable. The staff is friendly and they are pet friendly. The breakfast is what you get everywhere else...quick and enough to get you on the road quickly.	4.0
We stayed at this hotel in August, it is in the center of Silverton and walking distance to everything you need.

We were extremely satisfied with our stay. They have an excellent breakfast which we enjoyed everyday we were there. The rooms have everything you need for an extended stay. Everything you would need for cooking and serving meals, plus a full size refrigerator, microwave, stove and oven. Very comfortable room. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. Joy at the front desk was very helpful during our stay.

We were there for 3 nights and used it as a staging area for sightseeing in DC and Baltimore. It's a nice, new hotel with reasonable rates. The staff was great with our kids, who had a blast at the pool and the 24/7 snack bar. The continental breakfast was great, but they should consider expanding their hours or at least allowing guests to finish the food that is out at 10, because every morning the food was taken away promptly at 10:00 even though the area was packed with guests still trying to get breakfast. Parking was 13/day and right across the street, which is quite reasonable for the DC area.	5.0
The bed was uncomfortable It was close walking distance to everything	4.0
We had a quick one night stay in Atlanta for business meetings. This hotel was great in terms of being quiet, short shuttle drive from Airport. The staff was very friendly at the front desk.

roomy, great price, very helpful front desk close to all disney parks. they only serve continental breakfast. they have fridge, coffee maker microwave in the room. this is really in kissimmee area between the street markers of 5 6. very near to good restaurants supermarkets.	5.0
Truly a magnificent hotel. Beautiful, spacious rooms massive bathrooms. Not anywhere near the strip, but if you are a hiker/climber, this a great location to access the Red Rock Canyon/Spring Mountain Recreation areas. Would go back in a heartbeat. Stay away from the tight slots though.	5.0
This Sheraton Four Points is unlike most others: has a distinctly contgemporary feeling about it with nice visual touches and comfortable rooms. The biggest surprise was the breakfast caf where made to order omelets were available along with all the other breakfast items you would expect. A very pleasant stay.	5.0
My wife will thank me forever. Wonderful hotel in Miami, not on the main beach strip but I would say in a better position, if what you want to do is relax and enjoy the area. The rooms were superb and we had one with a huge balcony overlooking the harbour and pool. Breakfast was just and simply amazing especially when sitting outside in the morning. Pool area well maintained and serviced by staff. There are very few amenities outside of the hotel, one has to walk for about 10 minutes to get to shops etc. Concierge services was very helpful, a big shout out to Carlos who was the most helpful concierge guy we had come across for a while, he is a mine of information about the local area. This hotel oozes luxury and very family friendly, my family of 4 was really looked after, Two small gripes, the hotel should have somewhere in the evening where a family can enjoy drinks and desserts, that is not the bar, very often we could not get a space there in the evening or felt uncomfortable to be there with kids, the other point being in room dining could be improved, the menu was a bit short for us and the kitchen was not flexible enough to tailor some dishes, for example making the pasta spicy, we ordered some rice with our chicken and it was just undercooked , it was changed immediately and we were given complimentary glasses of wine but it was too late when one is starving !	5.0
We stayed for 11 nights and this hotel is absolutely wonderful. We had a king suite with separate bedroom and it was contemporary, comfortable and well-appointed.

This is hard to do because the owners are really nice, but I have to be honest. There is a smell that seems to be in every Days Inn I've ever stayed in. Like..the rooms have a TASTE to them that isnt pleasant. I'm not talking about smoking rooms. My room was non-smoking, and it had that taste. I think it may be a product/room freshener or something that lingers. The furniture had sticky spots even after the room was cleaned, and I think its from that product. The smell gets all in your clothes, cigarettes..not good. Would I stay again Maybe. The pool was fun. The Asst Manager came to help me with an appliance issue, and while he did some things, he was supposed to come back and he never did. The pool was fun. There are all kinds of shopping and food around there. Wal-Mart/Golden Corral around the corner, good food right next door (mostly fried food though). Would I stay there again Maybe..but only AFTER seeing/smelling my room first.	4.0

We have eaten at many other McMenamins before so for my son's birthday we chose the one in McMinnville since we were there for a track meet at Linfield. BIG MISTAKE!!!!

This motel should not be listed as an option. The rooms smell dank and the bathroom has a lot of black mold the carpet is torn, the curtains hang by a thread. It's a place good only for the drunkards and other destitute residents who live there semi-permanently. It's a disgrace.	1.0
The rooms were clean, servers and front desk very courteous. A little expensive at 105++ a night but not bad. Rooms were older - carpets worn. Breakfast decent but not all that good. I would certainly come back (and recommend) as it had comfy beds, working AC and very nice staff.	3.0

Very busy, efficient-enough airport location. Rooms quite OK.. housekeeping fine.. but hotel is getting run down. Some modern era touches lacking, i.e., not enough power outlets near desk or bed.

Bad: 195 a night (including resort fee) is expensive but it is Miami and all hotels seem to be this much, I cant fault the hotel so its a case of pay up and smile!. Good: Excellent location at the quiet end of Ocean Drive but still within walking distance of bars and restaurants, beach, shops and local buses. Very comfy beds, beach towels and chairs available for use. Free glass of wine on an evening was a nice touch.	5.0

I stayed at the Brookshire Suites for one week and enjoyed my stayed. One thing that I was really disappointed with was the room service they did not do a good job at cleaning the room. Out of the 5 days that I stayed there, I only allowed room service to clean my room on the third day. I expected them to resupply me with all the essentials in the bathroom. I was short on towels, soap, and shower gel. I was more furious when I notice that they did not provide me with a trash bag for the room trash can. Not to mention that when I walked in on the first day of my stay, under the sink there was a bag filled with trash from the previous stay. It did not bother me at first but after noticing how awful there room service is led me to write this review.	5.0
Stayed at this hotel for a single, mid-week stay for an industry conference. I have mixed feelings about this property.

We had a quick overnight stay here while traveling from Atlanta to Boston. At the end of a 12 hour day in the car, this was a great place to pull into! The woman at the front desk was extremely nice, the room was very clean, and the beds were super comfy. Bonus, they are pet friendly, and it can be hard to find a place that will take 2 dogs. I would definitely stay here again.	5.0
The staff here was really great - courteous, helpful, well-informed. The room was comfortable and the kitchenette a real boon. Great value for money. If we're in the area we'd stay there again. Breakfast was nice enough, though a bit more variety would have been nice.	5.0
The Saint Hotel is a top notch hotel located only half a block from the action of Duval St. From the check-in experience, to the amazing upgraded room overlooking the beautiful infinite pool and the convenience of the prime location in Key West this place was awesome. Upon check-in I was helped to my room by the amazingly helpful and friendly staff and I was directed to some places I should check out for the nightlife all within walking distance. The next 2 days, I started my mornings with the complimentary continental breakfast followed by exploring the island of Key West on 1 of the complimentary hotel bikes. I was able to end my afternoons with some relaxation in the amazing pool area. The entire staff was extremely helpful and professional throughout my stay. It was great to see the manager Abraham was very active with the everyday workings of the hotel staff and guests to ensure everyone has a great, unforgettable experience at the Saint. I would without a doubt stay at The Saint on my next trip to Key West!!Miss Elissa, Very Nice, you told me you were going to write a review, but I didn't expect all this, your writing has definitely spread smiles throughout the employees. Thank You, the whole staff thanks you. We are delighted you chose The Saint Hotel during your stay in Key West, you were a fun guest, easy to talk to and a delightful ray of sunshine around the property. Should your future travels bring you back to Key West, we hope The Saint Hotel will be your preference out of the many hotels to choose. Once again Thank You for the wonderful review.	5.0
Be aware that this hotel is currently being renovated. My room itself was OK, though the bathroom didnt seem like the renovation was finished. Poorly installed sockets and a cracked shower unit. The peephole on the door wasnt complete and had a Kleenex stuffed in it. I assume the construction also affected the breakfast, which was way below the style I expect at a La Quinta. Rate was too high for the level of room and breakfast provided. Dear Traveler, Thank you for taking the time to post a review on behalf of your stay with. We apologize that some of the renovations were taking place during your stay. It is through your feedback that we are able to improve what we do. It is our hope you will come back and see us again.

I thought the hotel was beautiful from Miami like bar to the indoor pool and Jacuzzi to the Cooked-to -Order buffet breakfast. The prices weren't bad except for the 50 incidental hold they add to ur credit card. And the room should come with free wi fi. I mean they need to get with it. Even motel 6 offers that for free. But outside of that. Great service.	4.0
Good: We loved our stay at this hotel. All the staff specially the people in the front desk were extremely nice. Our room was very clean. Bed was really comfortable. The pool area was very relaxing.

Not only did the shower for my room not have hot water (so they gave me another room but still it was inconvenient when I was rushing to catch a train), but the new room they assigned me to had extremely hot water running in the toilet!

The hotel definitely has been very well refurbished and the condition of everything is of high quality, EXCEPT that it doesn't seem they've worked out all of their plumbing details yet.	3.0

Hyatt Place was in a great location. Tons of restaurants nearby and short walking distance to the harbor. The rooms were so neat and clean and so comfortable. I really enjoyed it. The only downfall was parking. The hotel doesn't have its own parking garage. They do have Valet parking but it was too expensive. Good thing there was a municipal parking garage right behind the hotel that was cheap because there wasn't a lot of street parking nearby. We ended up taking ubers to other locations that were longer distances so we didn't have to go in and out of the parking garage and pay each time.	5.0

I just needed a place to sleep for a night and with no child this time, I have few needs. The room has a new microwave and decent size fridge, good bed, wifi, normal bathroom and sink area. Definitely great for the price and I would stay here again!	4.0
I went to a meeting in the hotel and had the opportunity to visit many of the rooms, suites and the lounge. The rooms had recently been renovated in variety of styles but all in keeping with the history of the hotel and all stunning.Dear francescaintinc, We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

STAFF MEMBERS WERE NICE. QUIET PLACE .TOOK A WHILE TO GET CHECKED IN. THE ROOMS GOT A LITTLE MUSTY I GUESS DUE TO BAD VENTILATION. OVERALL STAY WAYS OK. BELOW MY EXPECTION	3.0
Excellent small hotel, nicely decorated, our room overlooked the marina which was not busy during a cold snap. Nice harbor view. TV should be updated but gave a clear picture. Room was large, clean and quiet. A nice refuge from the big hotels now under construction every where in Clearwater. Front desk was welcoming and ready to help.	4.0
I was only here for a one night stay but was so impressed with the room, the amenities, the staff and the views from the rooftop pool that I plan on returning in the future for a longer stay. The Sunday Brunch was excellent!	5.0
The location was fine since everything on the island is a short trip away. But the room smelled of spray disinfectant and was extremely small it didn't even have a closet although it had everything else it was jammed in there. Actually everything was jammed in, they did not have a separate area for the breakfast it was set up in the lobby which is small as well and which you had to walk back and forth to four separate sections to get to as people are checking in and out and leaving for the day. Even the hallways were small and you had to squeeze around the cleaning carts or move them. I will say they use every space available they can. The pool was nice and the staff as well although it seemed disorganized. I didn't hate my stay but i felt i was overcharged.	3.0
Bad: Spa (No pool and No available time). Breakfast. Good: Breakfast wasn't ready. No coffee, no plates, nothing in the hot thing. Really a disapointment.	2.0
Great location. Front desk staff very accommodating. Will go back.	5.0
Bad: The room smelled of spoiled food and there was hair from a drain left in the toilet when I arrived. Also mold on the grout in the shower. I would have asked to change rooms, but I was in a hurry to get to an appointment. Good: Location and exceptional staff. Especially the front desk and valet staff.	4.0
The staff was amazing and helpful. Very clean and quiet. Room was beautiful. Will highly recommend to anyone.	5.0
Bad: It's not the hotels fault, but the sirens on the street woke me up. Good: The best bed I've slept in besides the one at home! Enjoyed all the pillows! Even though the hotel is older, the room was fine! The bathroom was generous, with a good shower.	5.0
The folks at the concierge desk are very helpful in directing you on where to go, what to do, and how to get there. The hotel is within walking distance of Chinatown. The tub in the junior suite is large and oh-so-nice after spending the day shopping or walking the wharf!	5.0
We took our two grand children to see DC and stayed at the Embassy because of its convenience to the city. Our grandson has extreme food restrictions due to food alergies so we were not sure how this trip would go. It was his first trip away from home. TWe explained to the chef and server that he needed special food preparation and care. They went far and above to make sure his needs were met and to follow up that he was taken care of. Thanks to these good folks we feel more comfortable about travelling with him. The Embassy staff made this a great summer for our grandson.	5.0
Adrianna was ghetto. Jay was trying to be professional in his t-shirt and jeans, even trying to correct my English. I've stayed at this property several times and was pleasantly satisfied. I simply needed a place to sleep, wash, and change for conferences that keep me out of the room more than in. Unfortunately, this session was horrible. I'm currently on the line with customer service seeking resolution. Again, before this stay I've never had these concerns. (Side note: the rate was higher than I've ever paid this time. I would think they customer service would match). Jay told a lie to the customer service agent and said he gave me time to make arrangements. He said he could lie because I lied on his front desk agent I simply shared how she acted.Mu, Thank you for sharing your concerns. Please know the service issues you describe are an exception to our guest commitment, and as such, we apologize. Our staff aims to provide the highest level of hospitality to our guests through our customer service, but with your experience, we have fallen short and would like to apologize for the service issues you describe.

the rooms ac was leaking causing the floor to be wet around the window and ac. the hair dryer and phone didnt work. the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night. the sheets had crumbs and sparkles on them. Maintenance fixed the problems but its ridiculous they dont inspect their products.	2.0
Never ever again. The rate for this rooms are to high. Dirty old room,smells like an ex smoking room. Keep the doors closed ,Highway behind the Window and Moskitos. Personal is not friendly. Badest Best Western i ever had.	1.0
My experience in this hotel was perfect! Rooms are clean, well-appointed, not so big but privided of all comforts (Tv, coffee machine, bathroom, and free wifi). In each floor, near the lift, you can find a free water dispenser with new bottles and also some chocolates and candys. Every day at 5.00pm, in the lobby is arranged a complementary wine free for the hotel hosts. The hotel is very well mainteined and clean but the strenght point is the position in the city. It is located in the loop (the city center) on the river in front of the Trump tower. It is really close to millenium park and magnificent mile (two of the most touristics place in the city). Moreover the hotel is close (5-7minutes by walk) to the underground line for the O'Hare airport. The staff of the hotel is extremly avaible and ready to meet all you needs. I was in chicago for a business travel so i can't give you informations about costs because i didn't manage the booking of the hotel. Anyway, after my experience, absolutly, I would suggest this hotel for a pleasant and comfortable stay in chicago.Dear Concetta D,Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for taking the time to provide a detailed review of your experience. We are thrilled to know you found everything to your liking. We really enjoy passing on comments such as yours to our colleagues and thanking them for their great guest service.We sincerely appreciate your recommendation!	5.0
Stayed at this motel while racing at maryhill loops.

We truly enjoyed the forest atmosphere around the lodge. The room was great and the comfort level was excellent. It was very quiet in the lodge and there was lots of gathering places to read, or just relax. The morning breakfasts were outstanding. The staff went out of their way to accomodate my dietary needs. We will return.	5.0
We were looking for a hotel at the last minute. As soon as we walk in the staff were very courteous and friendly, very helpful in finding the best pricing and fulfilling my hotel needs. I was serviced by Davian, she was very willing and helpful. I commended her for the outstanding service she provide. Next time we visit Key West this will be our place to stay.Dear Catherine A,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We are Happy to see that you enjoyed your stay with us and that our staff was very courteous and friendly. It is always nice to see our staff mentioned. We hope to see you back in Key West soon!Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager	5.0
The three best things about the Saga Motor Hotel: location, location, location. Right on Colorado Boulevard, across the street from Pasadena City College, the Saga can best be described as a 1950s motor lodge. That is, its a place you can sleep in relative comfort, but the decor is sadly in need of updating. The TripAdvisor photo taken in 2011... More	3.0
"Room 217. Shower flow rate was low - just a trickle. Hot water was luke-warm at best - no ""hot"" water. Shower drain was in the middle of a flat tiled shower floor sloping toward the back end of the shower where water puddled up and did not drain, leaving soap scum, etc. - very unsanitary. Bathroom sink did not drain well, leaving shaving cream, soap scum, whiskers in sink after shaving by the time it drained - and the drain had a ""sewer"" smell. There were unrepaired holes in the drywall at the bathroom door jamb. I put clothing into the dresser drawers and the drawers would not stay shut - annoying! Refrigerator made a loud humming noise - on and off about every 3-5 seconds. No continental breakfast included (unless you want to pay $9 to have it delivered to your room.) One evening, I decided to use the hot tub outside (because I was rather cold and knew I couldn't take a hot shower). The palm tree trimmers did not cover the hot tub that day, so they had dropped palm tree trimmings into the hot tub rendering it unusable. The pool cleaning company was there the next evening to clean it out."	1.0

Poorly maintained facility. Could be cute and quaint but needs work. Friendly staff and informative about area, but can't make up for lack of care at motel. Better places to stay for the money. Right on river so view is nice.	3.0

Bad: Bathroom a bit small. Good: Good hotel. Close to beach and bars and restaurants. Good staff	4.0
This hotel is absolute garbage. From the quality of the rooms to the entire staff,absolutely nothing held up to standards you would expect from a 4 star hotel. Good luck if you want to actually make it to the airport on time, their shuttle service was a complete joke.	1.0
I had to attend a meeting here and decided to stay the night. The room was clean and the staff was pleasant. Nice pool andJacuzzi. Coffee shop also served Starbucks coffee but had their own sandwiches which were really good and worth the price. Most of the other guests there also had breakfast there rather than in the nearby mall and were happy with their orders as well. The mall is also quite near, walking distance with a wide selection of food.	4.0
Bad: The valet parking is more expensive than at other hotels. However, we were able to find parking around the corner for 30 less. Good: The staff were very friendly and helpful with questions regarding the best way to reach sites. The game room on the second floor was fantastic and not at all crowded which is what I had anticipated. The hotel photos are exactly what you see when you arrive (this is often not the case with other hotels I've stayed in).	4.0
The room was clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Our only complaints were that the tv had terrible reception and had lines through the screen. Also there was definitely people smoking pot on our floor as we could smell it everyday. The only other things were obviously unavoidable, like the construction right next door that was very loud, and the power going out one morning.	3.0
I was very uncomfortable after seeing ants in my room and the tub acrylic was chipping away... This stay was not sanitary!!! We moved to another room but my comfort level was gone!!! I just felt dirty!!! I expected a better stay for the price I paid.	1.0

Booked through online site and they got my name wrong over the phone but that wasn't the hotels fault. It wasn't the worst place I have stayed at all. A few problems though. The internet did not work in the room or the lobby on any of our devices, ipod, ipad, laptop, nothing. Did use the computer in the business center. They advertise a breakfast buffet in the lounge but it wasn't represented well with that title. Consisted of eggs, waffle (premade), cereal, toast so I was a little disappointed. The shuttle picked us up at the Metro 15 minutes late after I called twice. Otherwise, the staff was friendly and the room was clean.	3.0
I have had to stay here quite a few times over the past few years. Staff nice, room clean, nice beds,etc,etc. BUT. Terrible acoustics mean you hear everything. And as they have wedding parties every weekend you have to suffer noise and disruption from wedding guests staying in the hotel. Up until 5am at times. No sleep for me. Smoking and drinking outside the front lobby, and no one to stop them until I phoned at 2am to complain. Where is the noise coming from , I was asked Right in front of you , I said. They need to MANAGE this. Not put non wedding guests on floors with guests, and they should put polite notices up about noise. During the week fine - but avoid the weekend unless you like being kept up all night.	2.0
We used this hotel for a visit with family nearby. The hotel was clean and employees friendly. They had us on second floor, upon arrival I asked for first floor and they made it possible.

I wanted to stay overnight for the Air Show there were 600,000 people in AC, so I knew we would have to pay top dollar to stay anywhere. All the Casinos were booked and all the board walk properties were also booked with the exception of the 2 star Days Inn which wanted 280 per night. I decided to go for the best western 129 even though I had read some questionable reviews. We were suprised at how nice the hotel looked. It was clean nice tiled bathroom new looking carpet on hall floors and in the room. The AC in our room worked fine and was on when we got there. There was a nice sized frige, coffee machine and blow dryer. The halls were warm because windows were open (no AC on). We had a great complimentary breakfast in the morning including fresh make your own belgium waffels, bagles, pastries, muffins juices and coffee. Staff was friendly and helpful. Being a city girl I was definately on my guard walking the one long block from the boardwalk at night 1AM but it was well lit and had several clubs and resturants along the way. It is also centrally located to all the Casinos and the beach has a boardwalk entryway with a rinse off shower and public bathrooms.	4.0
Clean quiet room with comfortable bed. Free breakfast and internet. Good view of the lake, we were even treated to a firework show on the night of stay.

This was a convenient stop on our road trip along route 90, but the quality was not as good as other Red Roofs. We had to request soap for the shower, and the sheets were worn out.

The hotel is in a good location near Oak mall. However, the receptionist was not there when I came to check in. It took me more than a minute standing waiting for her.

The photos are very misleading. The ceiling in my room and bathroom was falling and bathroom full of mold. I complained but was told there was no other room available. I listened to numerous complaints from other guests while I waited in line to complain. The front desk gentleman was indifferent to the complaints and not much was resolved. I was in town for business and have never stayed in a worse down town 'hotel and conference center' in the hundreds of cities I've traveled to.	2.0

Bad: Every now and again, we could hear bass from another room. However, it was never during sleeping hours so that was positive. Good: Everyone was super friendly and helpful.

"Phantastic location in Charleston Historic District. The hotel comes along with ""Sothern Comfort"" and a historic 18th Century flair mixed with modern amenities.

Overall I had a great stay at this hotel. I was traveling alone with three children four years old and younger and needed a place to overnight that was safe, affordable and comfortable. The room was a great size, the beds and pillows were very comfortable and the linens were good quality. We arrived after midnight and the hostess that greeted us was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast spread was nice and the pool area looked amazing though sadly we had no time to enjoy it. Only negative I had with this stay is that I requested a crib for the night and it was not set up when we got into the room. Unfortunately we checked in so late that although there was a crib available for the front desk to provide one, were no linens for it. Since I had a portable one in my car this wasn't a big deal for me (other than an extra trip out to the parking lot).	4.0

Ill be back! Clean and comfortable, with staff that will go above and beyond to make your stay wonderful. We came here for the Napa to Sanoma Half Marathon, and we are quite pleased with our choice. We knew we would not be in the room much, so price was what we were looking for. The Napa Valley is not cheep! But I felt the prices here were reasonable. The convenience of the shuttle to the start of the race was also a selling point for us. We saw many people driving here that morning parking across street to get here in time for the shuttle. AND! right across the street was a nice shopping center with many shops and fast food. Well done Best Western... Well done!Thank you so much for your review.

We found the rooms large, and comfortable. Price was affordable, staff were nice and helpful. We did find the room did not contain much in the way of utilises, and we had to call or drop down to get cups and glasses, etc. Shower were warm, not hot. Lower floor room might have been better.	4.0

The location wasn't exactly where i thought it was but that was partly my fault, there are 2 Fairfield's in Key west and I got confused with the second one. However it was nice and close to airport which is what I was looking for at first. The Hotel had a nice room, Clean, and everything you needed to just have a nice stay. They had a contential breakfast at the hotel and that was nice. It had a great selection with staff that worked really hard the entire time to keep everything stocked, cleaned, and looking nice.

We stayed 3 nights in a room that faced a courtyard. There are no elevators so we were very appreciative of the help with our heavy suitcases up the stairs.

If you're simply looking for a place to stay for a night or two, this place fits the bill. It would probably serve the purpose for a lengthier stay if you're fishing with a bunch of buddies. It's not fancy, by any means, but it's perfectly acceptable. Reservation process was handled online and by email with no problems. Check-in was... More	4.0
Me and my family recently stayed at the Sea Captain Resort as a last minute get away. This place is very small and quiet. They offer breakfast on the weekends. They also have free parking and Wi-Fi.

We checked in and after trying two rooms we immediately checked right back out and slept in the car. The beds had hair in them and makeup and dirt on the pillow cases and sheets.

The Dickinson Hampton Inn Suites is the best Hampton hotel I have stayed in. I have been a Hilton Honors Gold and Diamond member since 2007, and this is the best stay I have ever had with the Hilton properties. This hotel deserves your business if you are traveling to Dickinson ND.	5.0
Stayed here a couple of nights. Rooms were clean and bed was comfortable. I think this property is great for business travelers. Breakfast was just ok. The service at breakfast was great!

The man at check desk was rude and yelled at me. The door was poorly hung, therefore you could see light, the bathroom fan was so loud you could not shower with the light on, there was a very thin and hole filled blanket on the bed, there was no coffee pot or microwave as promised, the fridge froze the contents, the carpet was gross on bare feet, and there were no hand towels only a wash cloth and bath towels. Was robbed by this stay. WAY more money than it was worth!!!!!	1.0
This was hands down one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. Granted I wasn't spending a lot of time around a pool or in my room but its located nicely and had amazing beds.

We have spent a number of nights at this motel. It is always very clean, breakfast above average, friendly staff. When we checked out we mentioned how heavy the bed covers were.

I stayed in a huge two-room suite here, and I just don't understand the appeal. Perhaps my tastes are just not, ahem, refined enough, but I found the hotel to be a bit stuffy and uninspiring. This was the 3rd or 4th St. Regis that I've stayed at, and I finally realized that the brand just isn't for me. I guess I prefer more modern or unique hotels. It wasn't a bad experience, and the separate living room would be helpful for entertaining a certain type of client, but I wouldn't stay here alone and I wouldn't stay here for a romantic trip.The service was spectacular in the suite, and included a private butler. That said, I don't really need a private butler when I stay in a hotel. The front desk workers were friendly if not downright charming. The hotel lobby is small and, for my tastes, uninteresting. It lacks the wow factor. The concierge was very good, but seemed to sigh when he realized I had such pedestrian questions such as what new broadway shows might be worth seeing (I've been to NYC more than 30 times, but I always ask the basics).For the money, I'd pick the Waldorf Astoria or the Gramercy Park hotel for its warm, sumptuous colors and textures (in the larger rooms) or even the Mandarin Oriental.Note - I stayed in this hotel in 2014.Dear Allen,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your stay with us.We are sorry to learn that the style of our historical property did not meet your preferences, but are glad to read that you enjoyed our team's service. As far as our Concierge is concerned, rest assured I will personally follow-up and use your feedback as a re-training opportunity.When Mr. John Jacob Astor and his wife Caroline built the hotel in 1904, on purpose, they wanted to have a very small lobby to make the arrival experience of their friends and family members as intimate and as home-like as possible. While we treasure and value the heritage of our hotel, we do realize that the lobby size might not be of a wow factor and we apologize if you were disappointed.Hopefully you will visit us again and give us more opportunities to be at your service.Have a wonderful start of the new year!!Sincerely,DanielaOn behalf of The St. Regis New York Team	3.0
Omni Royal Orleans offered convenient location, and loads of amenities. The staff is gracious and really makes you feel at home from the second you arrive outside the front entrance.

The facility was not bad for the price the room was clean, beds were good and everything worked. The people that stay there however were unpleasant to be around.On day1my girlfriend could not walk out of her room without getting harassed by a gentlemen with his pants on the ground so she had to be escorted every time she left the room. The same group partied till 5a.m. and our room wreaked of the weed smoke from the room next door. Day 2 there were several ferral children running around some naked all unattended while parents chain smoked Pall Malls on the steps. Again the facility was nice ,it was clean and was not bad except for the other guests.	2.0

The Troubadour is a hotel that is clearly run by seasoned professionals. It is modern and beautifully appointed. The staff is friendly and welcoming. The room was spacious, the bed incredibly comfortable , the bathroom had every amenity and the largest and nicest shower imaginable. The rooftop bar was lively, had a great view, drinks and DJ. It is a short walk to the French Quarter. Do not hesitate to stay there!Thank you for taking time to complete a review of your recent stay. I'm thrilled to hear you had an enjoyable stay.

Housekeeping was also terrific, never ran out of anything.

The rooms are actually really nice and updated. The common areas are older and outdated, but rooms are surprisingly nice. Motel 6 immediately next door to Hilton and Marriott Marquis, but a third the price.Nice new fridge and microwave in room. My dog was allowed at no extra cost. Room was quiet. Couldn't hear hallway noise. If you don't mind missing the extra common area atmosphere, swimming pool, pricey restaurants, etc and just want a clean safe modern room with all the necessary amenities and free parking, come here. Free parking in downtown Atlanta is unheard of. Gave cleanliness a 4 cuz comforter smelled musty, but everything else was perfect. Overall a 4 cuz of no extras besides the nice room and free parking.	4.0

Quiet, clean, spacious. Only complaint is the beds were sacked out. We're traveling cross country and just need a place for a good night sleep and a shower for a reasonable price. This place fit the bill. Ate downtown at Buon Appetit and it was great also	4.0
The staff and hotel were very nice. The rooms were modern and obviously recently redone (at least our 13th floor room was.) The building itself is old, but it looks good inside. The lobby and bar are clean and modern. There is a pool table and lots of games to entertain kids and the young at heart in the lobby area.Downtown Philly is heavily populated with the homeless. The Methodist Church across Arch St from the Aloft Downtown seems like a focal point for them. Several times I was approached for a handout, but never felt like my wife, son and I were in any danger. I wouldn't necessarily recommend walking alone after dark in the area, but it is a bustling area during the day. We walked back as a group to the hotel from City Hall subway station after a Phillies game (maybe 11:30pm) and it was fine.It is very easy to get to a bus or subway train in a 5-10 minute walk. The views of City Hall are stunning and Love Park, the Reading Terminal Market, even Independence Hall and the Museum of Art are all walkable. The Convention Center is right next to the Aloft, so it would be a good place to stay if you were attending a conference there.There were always Uber and Lyft drivers a minute or 2 away when we needed to get anywhere. There are also cabs and the hotel offers Valet parking for 50 or so a night. There are also several parking ramps and some street parking in the area as well.There is a McDonalds across the street, but no restaurant in the building. There is a small store for food and drinks inside the lobby and a 7-11 convenience store a block away down the street on Broad St. Otherwise, I didn't find a ton of food options immediately around the hotel, but there are a lot of options a couple blocks away.It is certainly not cheap, but I liked the hotel and I would stay there again the next time I go back to Philadelphia.Hi JW, Thank you for the FIVE BUBBLE review! We get excited when our guests connect with our hotel and city as you did. Your last line I would stay there again is what we all work hard to accomplish. We also appreciate your taking the time to provide other travelers your experience outside the hotel. Our pride extends beyond our hotel and into our community. It's great that you're sharing personal and authentic stories, thank you for that. I hope all your travels bring you much joy!Evan	5.0
Here's a few observations. We had an early flight in, and we were able to enjoy the pool by getting 'pre' checked in, and texted us when the room was ready. Very nice.

My daughter and I stayed here for a Mother's Day getaway. The hotel is in a great location, especially if you're here when they have the Napa Farmers Market located at the edge of the parking lot. There is also a nice movie theater in the same parking lot. This is a new hotel with a nice layout. The housekeeping needs some improvement both in the rooms and the breakfast area. They do offer free wine tasting in the evenings which was nice.	4.0
Excellent experience. Due to a mix-up on my part with the online travel service it was set up as a king rather than two queen beds, for two guys. I immediately called at the time and Hampton said they would make a note that a room with two queens was needed. When i got there, they didn't have a 2-queen room so they put me up in another king room (and my buddy stayed in the original room) at NO additional expense, and I moved to a 2-queen room the next day. That is awesome, customer-oriented service.	5.0

In town for a funeral. The hotel was okay. Heat/AC was noisy. Wires across floor in common area a trip hazard. Employees were pleasant. The room was a little suite, but was oddly set up.

I stayed here for AmericasMart was excited about the fresh paint cleanliness of my room. However, between the hours of 2-5 the front desk staff were incredibly noisy EVERY day (I was here for a week). It was very frustrating. It is more expensive for a Motel 6, but again, the location is great.	4.0

We only stayed one night, but we can see why it would be good for an extended stay. The room had a small kitchen and work area. We prefer to stay at hotels that offer a full breakfast, which this one didn't but that was okay, we just went to the Waffle House down the street. This is not a complaint by the way. We were mainly looking for a hotel close to Interstate 64 for one night and the lack of a full breakfast was not a big deal to us. The staff were friendly and courteous and the room was clean and adequate for our needs. We would stay here again if we are ever in the area.	4.0
This location is as good or better than the average Hampton Inn. Food is great. Room is great but doesn't have a fridge. The only negative is if you have a large vehicle due to the (free) parking garage on the property.	5.0

We were looking for a place to stay outside of Boston and all the motels in this area seemed to be full. We found this one, overpriced, but thought we had no choice. We positively hated it and moved to the all-new Motel 6 for the rest of our stay. It was cheaper, much newer and cleaner.	1.0
Good: everithing beyond our expectations.	5.0
Couples quick getaway from the valley. Perfect little boutique hotel right in the middle of downtown, on whiskey row. Walk to everything. It was clear that the owners gave attention to every detail of the hotel and each room in this tasteful remodel. The rooms were very modern yet kept that period feel and history of the hotel. Very clean,... More	5.0
We were at the hotel for our spring break for two nights. The staff are friendly and helpful. The hotel room was clean and specious. The evening reception and breakfast were great.

Nice, clean, comfortable and affordable, all with a great hot breakfast and close to GMU. Wish they had an outdoor pool, but much better than local competitors.	5.0
One of the best hotels I ever stayed at! Perfect in every way! The location is perfect - between the Old Courthouse and the Arch Plaza. 2 blocks from Busch Stadium. A free shuttle to Busch brewery only 2 blocks away. The fitness center and pool is awesome! There are 2 bikes, 3 treadmills, 1 elliptical, many weights, weight machines... More	5.0
Good location, but DIRTY hotel! In my opinion, it should be DOWN-rated to a 2-star hotel. It's OLD, the room I stayed in smells musty, and the common areas were DIRTY!	1.0
Good: Friendly staff. Every thing was perfect.	5.0
Even before I arrived at Soniat I had an insight into the warm hospitality that was the theme throughout our stay. From the warm, helpful welcome from Mark and his coleague, to the professional manner of Calvin, the housekeepers and the managers, they could not do enough. I hesistate to use the term hotel to describe Soniat, that's like calling Buckingham palace a house. The rooms are luxurious, I really want that bed in my home. Situated on a peaceful street, with a church next door, and well situated to get around the French quarter, and other attractions. Everything is quaint, peaceful, and friendly, a haven. The setting is beautiful courtyards, with water features, classical music played softly, and a well stocked honour bar, what more could you want...wait did I mention breakfast No meals are served apart from breakfast and I absolutley rate it as a five star experience, my first taste of American biscuits was fab, they have to be the best biscuits, fresh orange juice, great coffee (apologies I'm drooling just thinking about it). It was a great choice, we hope to be back and I am more than willing to recommend it to anyone looking for an oasis of calm, warm hospitality. Go, you won't regret it.Wow!You have made my day!What a kind and thoughtful review. Thank you so very much for taking the time.It would be a real pleasure to welcome you back.	5.0
A good value for travelers. You don't get the premium amenities but the hotel is clean and comfortable. The continental breakfast is rather standard but solid, you shouldn't go hungry. Well located right off the interstate it is convenient. You can't beat it if you're travelling.	4.0
We stayed in one of their penthouses which had a beautiful private balcony. A nice bedroom, kitchen, and lovely living room. Every evening they have wine and cheese, followed by warm cookies. In the morning they have a lovely continental breakfast in the morning. Several blocks to the beach. Great Location. We stayed 5 days and could have stayed more!	5.0
I did not want to write a review when we first stayed as the owner told us he had just lost his wife. We stayed one night because of that..however the room was very, very shabby. The outside door offered little to no security...perhaps a closet door. The room was dingy and small. The kitchen had a tiny fridge w/half... More	2.0
This Candlewood Suites near the airport was more than adequate for my overnight needs as I needed quick access to FLL for an early morning flight.

This is an old style motel with external doors that has had the rooms redone.

When we first arrived inside the room a strong smell of mildew hit me. I decided to ignore it thinking it could be worse, and it was. Grasshoppers and other bugs were EVERYWHERE.

We stayed here 3 nights in March while on a week long trip of Hawaii. It was wonderful in every way. When you enter the lobby, the backdrop is an open air view of the Ocean. It is magnificent.

I was disappointed with the cleanliness of the room, which was very dated. The staff was super friendly, and I appreciated that. The breakfast area was crowded, and being on of the first rooms in the hotel, it seemed everybody wanted to walk by having a conversation at full volume while I was trying to sleep.	3.0
The point of us staying at this hotel was to have safe parking and use their shuttle service to get us to light rail and into the city. The shuttle only was available every half hour, and was full most of the time. We still ended up having to drive into the inner harbor and pay for parking. Not to mention that the hotel booked 4 wedding on one day. All of the wedding guests parked in the parking lot of the Hilton as well as the adjacent hotel, and we circled for hours trying to find parking to no avail. We had to park down the street and hope we didn't get towed. I had gone to the front desk to alert them of the issue. They couldn't be bothered with my issue. However, other guests stated that they were offered free valet, but then had to tip for the service. Definitely not worth the price considering it's no better than a Hampton Inn or something similar in a lower price range. Some of the desk personnel were lovely to deal with, but one in particular was irritated if you spoke to her.	3.0
We stayed three nights here recently and found the accommodations satisfactory. Clean room, quiet, everything worked well.

All round wonderful experience. From the time we got there to the time we left the staff and service was outstanding. Ryan the Guest services person who checked us in set the tone for the rest of the stay. He was extremely courteous and helpful with all our requests, offered us advice on transportation and dining in the area which was great. We ate at the Quarter Deck restaurant he recommended all three days we were there for lunch it was so good. Cant say enough good things about the Virginian Suites!!! If your looking for a nice clean place close to everything at about half the price of the hotels downtown, you have to stay at the Virginian Suites. Cant wait to go back.	5.0

I can't begin to describe how incredible this hotel is!! Service was beyond my expectations.

On my most recent work trip to NYC, I chose to stay at the St Regis vs my usual (The Peninsula). Never again will I go back. After a long day of client meetings, I decided to grab a light dinner and drink at the hotel lobby bar (King Cole Bar). I travel quite a bit for work and my one rule of thumb is to avoid being holed up in a room with room service. I headed straight to the bar after getting back to the hotel and intentionally grabbed a small table in the far corner as I knew I'd need to get some work in to clear all my emails from the day. Literally within 15 seconds of powering on my laptop, one of the servers bolted over to me and asked if I was aware that they had a No Laptop Policy after 4pm. Seriously I had to ask myself, was I really staying at a 5-star business property I politely pushed back and said I was a guest at the hotel and had to get some work done and would be out of there quickly after my meal. He looked annoyed but then retreated.Fast forward 15-20 minutes...my food and wine arrives and I'm not even halfway through. That's when the FB manager then approaches me. He actually had the audacity to ask how much longer will I be on my laptop as I am being disruptive. Again, to set the context, I am sitting in the far corner next to a pillar and had my laptop screen dimmed to the lowest setting. I am not engaging with anyone yet I'm being disruptive One would think an FB manager would have some business and common sense and decency to recognize that you don't go and ask a paying guest at the hotel to get up in the middle of a meal because they are working on their laptop. When I told him I didn't understand their policy and why he was enforcing it, he said I was not fitting in to the bar scene. Unbelievable. He then tells me he'd be happy to have my food and wine moved outside the bar where I could freely work. I am at this point just dumbfounded. It was like being asked to move to the back of the bus or get off the bus for that matter. Most humiliating and distasteful experience ever and never ever would I have imagined it would be on a work trip at what's supposed to be an upstanding hotel. And just to be clear, on the many occasions I've had to power up my laptop at the bar at The Peninsula to get some work done, not once did anyone ask me to turn off my laptop or leave. Crystal clear for me now...Dear sfellelle, On behalf of the Management team at The St. Regis New York, we would like to thank you for your visit. We appreciate you taking the time to detail your recent stay at our property.Our hotel prides itself on providing five star service, yet in some cases, mistakes can occur. We apologize for the experience that you encountered in our Food and Beverage department, and please know that this is certainly not our standard. Rest assured, we took the necessary measures to do an internal follow up with our staff to ensure that all our guests have a flawless experience in our bar in the future in similar circumstances.We most certainly hope you will give us another opportunity to service you again in the future. Please don't hesitate to contact me directly to book your next visit or to discuss in length your experience at: Octavia.margineanstregis.com. Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager	1.0
For its price point, Best Western Walla Walla is really pretty awesome.

Didn't stay long enough to really review things, but the room was pretty clean, even though I think my toilet was leaking. Speaking of toilets, you kinda have to jump over it to get to the shower which has a really low shower head. Not good for a 6' tall person. Be wary of the elevator, it's kinda creepy. Didn't get to check out the pool, but it looked decent enough. Friendly front desk service. Not the best location as far as traffic goes, but it's 15 minutes from most anything (amphitheater, beach, etc) so it was a pretty good spot to spend the night. If you're wanting an ocean-view, look elsewhere. It's worth the price I paid.	4.0
We booked this stay using Marriott points so we would be close to the airport for an early morning flight. The evening staff were very gracious.

We checked in late on Friday night. The desk clerk was very friendly and quick to help us get checked in. The only issue wass when we went to get in the room. You could only turn the handle upward to open the door. We met Alicia, manager at the front desk. the next morning. She was very informative of the surrounding area and helped us get around to places that we wanted to go to. The bathroom and whole room was very clean and pleasant. The whole staff were friendly professional. This will be my hotel of choice when I come to the Phoenix area. Thanks to Alicia and all the staff for helping in making it a great weekend stay.	5.0
My family had an amazing experience. We arrived early and staff had a room ready for us. The walk to the tram is very short.. breakfast was good but would preffered scramble eggs and potatoes.

Hotel is very nice, but I waited an hour at the metro station for the hotel shuttle bus.

Bad: Rooftop bar is more style than substance, go to be seen, not to enjoy view or surroundings, and inconvenient to have to go downstairs to go back up.

L'hotel en lui-meme n'est pas trop mal, les chambres aussi mais l'environnement n'est pas terrible. C'est une zone en bord d'autoroute, dans un suburb glauque, et quand meme tres loin du centre de Washington (30-40 minutes en voiture). De la fenetre de la chambre, vous avez la vue sur l'autoroute ou le toit de l'hotel avec plusieurs grosses climatisations qui tournent en permanence, d'ou un un bruit incroyable ! On se croirait encore dans l'avion.... Pas de restaurant digne de ce nom autours. La piscine est limite propre (l'eau est quasi opaque....) et praticable, bien que tres grande et surveillee. En revanche, le petit-dej est correct !!	3.0
The people as we arrived were very courteous and helpful with our luggage, check in was easy, took us to our room and made sure everything was ok with us.

The location of this hotel was amazing and the price was right. Unfortunately, it was a weekend and the hotel was hosting a wedding. As a result, it was very loud. I was assured by the staff that it would end around 10:30, but the party was yelling and slamming doors until at least 11:30. There was a note in my room to respect quiet time from 10p-6a, but I guess that applied only to me. I had an early morning event to attend, so I wouldn't recommend staying here on a weekend if you intend to get any rest. Also, my room had a shared bath, which was very poorly treated by whomever else was sharing it. Be advised that sometimes other guests might not be as civilized as you are.	3.0
Bad: Dont change a thing. Good: Staff was very accommodating even those we shared elevator rides with. Location was central and easy to walk places. We enjoyed our stay.	5.0
The heating unit didn't work in the first room I was moved to another room. The dinner menu in the restaurant was mostly sandwiches personally I eat sandwiches for lunch not dinner. I did try the burger one night and the cook cooked every bit of the juice out of the meat I might as well have had some of the desert sand.	2.0
I asked for non-smoking room but doubt very much that the room assigned was non-smoking. It literally stinks. The surrounding of the property was poorly maintained, hardly swept. The outdoor pool area was even worst. It looks like it hasn't been cleaned for weeks. The garbage cans were overflowing from the day I get there. The following evening, it was still the same way. This should be rated as .5 star.	1.0

Bad: There is nothing on website or booking.com about the rules, and there are many, at this hotel, or that it is a quiet hotel. There is nothing about quiet hours starting at 11 on the sites either. Nothing about the limit to number of people that can visit you in your room. Nothing about the fact that when people come to see you they will be detained at the gate and not allowed to enter if you have more than 4 extra people you are visiting with in your room or the outside courtyard area. If these are the rules then fine, but we would NOT have stayed here if we had known this .Please put this information on both sites so that others do not have the same experience we did. A woman in the office was very rude and threatened to call the police for no reason. She was extremely rude and disrespectful and threatening during our stay. There are ways to communicate respectfully and calmly and this was not the case. I would never ever ever tell anyone to stay at this hotel. In fact, I will tell everyone I know to avoid going to this hotel unless they want to be treated rudely. I am sure that this woman in the office will respond saying she was not rude or threatening, but take my word, I do not ever write reviews and this is exactly what occurred and it made the stay unpleasant and uncomfortable and impossible to make plans to go out with friends. Ridiculous.	3.0

Overall I rate this hotel as average in some areas, and above in others. First the good: Price considering the Napa Valley location it was a good value, at check in we received our free breakfast coupons for Denny's adjacent to hotel. The location makes it easy to get downtown, or cross the bridge to Hwy 29. Staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful, its like they get it be friendly to your guests and they will either return or recommend your hotel to others.Average in outside noise is noticeable, doors closing, street noise, people walking in rooms above you, showers in the morning...etc. Hotel is somewhat dated yet clean and pretty well cared for.I would stay here again.Thank you for staying with us. We are always working on upgrading our Hotel. We are in the process of adding a workout room, guest laundry and business center. Customer service is always number one with us and we will see you again on your next visit to the Napa.	3.0

Stay away. Booked with Hotwire as a 3 star hotel with a 95 approval rate. Hotwire should be ashamed. I wouldn't even give it a 1 star. I feel dirty just thinking about this place.

Where you are staying at the Concord, any other hotel or a private residence in Avalon, this is a go to place for quick food that is great.

This was a good hotel to stay in. We booked it through Priceline Express Deals so we did not voluntarily choose this hotel and paid much less than their listed prices.

I normally stay at the HIE here in Orangeburg, but since this hotel is brand new I wanted to give it a try. Checking was fast and the staff were friendly. This is a very nice hotel.

While generally speaking I believe that most next-tier hotels are overpriced, I have been satisfied with this Hampton. The staff is kind and caring for a college town, where mostly I see college-age kids running the desks.

I was extremely impressed with the room. We booked a two bedroom. Both rooms had king beds. This was not like any other Residence Inn- everything was on one floor and the entrance is not outside- it's very classy. I felt like I was in an extremely expensive hotel. I'm definitely staying here again!	5.0
We stayed here to attend Kentucky Derby and spent little time in the hotel. The pool was closed for repairs. Friendly staff and conveniently located next to highway. It seems everybody in town smokes, so lots of people hanging around entrance puffing away.	3.0

Hotel is right off of the main highway into VA Beach, so it's very quick to get in and out. It is right by the boardwalk as well, within walking distance of the pier. So overall, I love the location! The room is small and divided into two section--living area (with pull out couch or another queen bed depending on room selection), and bedroom. I did not like the bedroom being by the hallway, the wall isn't thin but you can still hear people at night. The bathroom is nicely renovated recently, which was a big plus. Wife and kids loved the balcony facing the ocean, we enjoyed watching the beach at dusk. Overall, we had a very pleasant 3 nights stay at this Comfort Inn and will definitely book it for next year's trip back to VA Beach.	5.0

The Mills House is centrally located in the middle of everything we wanted to do during our stay. The staff members were the friendlist I have ever met. The rooms were great. The only down side was the pictures posted were true to the appearance of the hotel, but not the rooms. The rooms were a little more modern than pictured, this did not take away from our enjoyment though. We were on the 5th floor and had a great view. I would stay here again on another visit.	5.0
Very enjoyable. The breakfast was excellent, just get down early. The hotel is within walking distance to the metro and the nightly shuttle offers service to the shops. It was great.	4.0
This all-oceanfront unit resort was long overdue for the addition of balconies. This is an older resort that has a great central location on the Virginia Beach Boardwalk.

The photo's looked fantastic. Our room however was not. The, a/c in the room was sellotaped into the window and was so noisy we couldn't sleep. Rooms were small. View was invisible due to the filthy windows and construction work opposite. The shower leaked and flooded the bathroom. The sink had no plug. No table or chest of drawers or anything in the room. This is in my opinion is scraping a 3 star if that definitely not a 4.We appreciate the feedback, Russell.We're disappointed that your stay with us was less than ideal. It's unfortunate you've noticed a decline in the quality of our accommodations, and that you had such challenges with your room. We care about the comfort of our guests so we'll address your concerns with our team moving forward.We hope for the opportunity to host you again soon for a more positive experience.	2.0

The best part of the stay at Metro Points besides check out was the staff. I commend them for working in such deplorable conditions. I was extremely disappointed. From the outside, peering through the window, the hotel is beautiful. When I entered I was met by stained carpet and dirty walls. Although check in was easy (Kudos to Mr. Davis) who worked hard to accommodate me. However, he could not fix the peeling paint, the spotty drapes, the snowy picture, the no wifi the entire time I was there, the sink with no running water and the tub with no knobs. This hotel has the potential to be very good. Management cannot be oblivious to all the defects. Management needs to get it together. It's the little things that keep customers or drive them away. I drove away with no intention of ever returning.	1.0
Well this was a surprise find, wonderful location, Marina view to our front and Harbour view to our back, the restaurant and bar were first class, good service and helpful staff.

My husband and I visited NOLA to celebrate our first wedding anniversary this past weekend. Upon our late arrival, we were greeted by the Valet and Bell Boy and quickly checked in for our stay. There was a mix up with the room key which stalled our 'settling' for 30 minutes, but we were told that the woman that assigned us the keys was on medication from a dental operation. The room was lush but small - neither of us minded, since we would be tourist hopping and eating all day any...view moreway. The view was great, and we were pleased that it was located far enough from Bourbon that you couldn't hear the crazy screaming drunkenness (though, Saturday was a bit louder than Friday). Room service was excellent and speedy. Information was readily available and the hotel was really clean. We didn't get to explore the upper deck pool area or dine at the Rib Room, but plan on staying here again - it's in the middle of everything and a really great value!view less	5.0
Enjoyed a three night stay at this Best Western while in the DC area. Booked two nights originally through Hotels.com and decided to stay one additional night and the staff honored the same price as the original price through Hotels.com.

During our stay at this establishment a lead assistant and a manger handled themselves extremely poorly. They were involved in a conflict which lead to very disappointed children and adults.

I have stayed at this hotel several times. It has a great location 1/12 blocks from Broad Street. The public area are very nice, and the staff is helpful and friendly. The rooms are nicely sized and well furnished. My only complaint is that the walls provide very little barrier to sound. We could easily hear the people in the adjoining room and the hallway. With a number of weddings going on the sound level was probably more than typical, however, be aware that your room could be noisy depending on who you are adjacent to.	4.0
This is a nice hotel in a good location close to some shopping and several food options. Because of its setup, it is pretty quiet at night which is nice considering it's on a main drag. The woman at the main desk was very pleasant and got us checked in quickly with no wait. It was around 8:00pm when we got there.The room was spacious and clean which is always appreciated especially at a reasonable price. My only complaint was that the ice machine on our floor was broken and most of the drink selections were empty so we had to go back down to the main floor to find what we were looking for.The breakfast was decent for the price we paid. There was fruit, yogurt, eggs, cereal, juice, bagels and waffles. The standard spread that one would expect. The food was continually stocked which was nice. My only complaint was the seating was very limited. There was not enough room for the amount of people showing up to breakfast, so we and a couple other groups had to stand for a while until someone offered us a seat.There also is a pool at this hotel which looked nice, but unfortunately, I didnt get to try it out. But from the looks of the people out on the patio, people loved it and it looked very well kept.I would definitely stay here again!	4.0

Went on May 2015. Rest of the DC hotels were either sold out or very expensive. Overall it was ok. Rooms were fairly clean, breakfast wasn't that good (always out of something), staff was helpful, check in/out was quick and painless. Free parking is a plus. Depending on the day/time its about 30-45 min to downtown DC by car. They also offer shuttle service to nearest train station till 10pm everyday. I'd pick a closer hotel to downtown, but like I said there wasn't anything below 300, 84 was a steal :)	4.0
Great hotel! If you are going on the Winetrain in Napa, it is conveniently located 5 - 6 minutes away and is a very safe, clean and comfortable place to stay.

Wonderful place to stay. Just a short walk to everything. Very clean but remember to take the do not disturb sign off your door before 11:00 am or there is no room service.

Traveled there a few weeks back for my 35th birthday and my stay at Aria was nothing short of AMAZING! Will definitely stay there again. From the staff to the food at the buffet and the cafe to the night life. One of the best stays I've had in Vegas!!	5.0
Our one night at this roach motel was awful. While the manager on duty was very pleasant, our room was less than satisfactory. There was no remote for the TV. The water in the bathroom ran lukewarm in the shower and sink. Two of our towels were a gross grey color. We asked for a non-smoking room but clearly someone had been smoking in our room quite recently. Worst of all, the people on either side of us decide... view mored to stand outside and talk very loudly until midnight. They screamed, yelled, slammed doors, and stomped back and forth for two hours. When we went to check out, there was no one available. We had to leave without being properly checked out. This roach motel is not worth the money.	1.0
The location of the Charlottesville Hyatt Place is excellent with a variety of food in walking distance. University of Virginia very accessible from this location. Front desk offered directions and guidance.	5.0
Bad: Mattresses too hard, carpet on lobby too old. Good: Locarion	4.0
I went here with friends from work and we had a good tome. They have a small bar area but was good enough for the ten of us. Only drawback was the slow food service as it took over an hour for chicken tenders. Probably would go to a different place next time.	4.0

Der har ikke vret noget at klage over. Virginian Suites har indeholdtog budt p de tjenesteydelser, vi selv har fordret. Derfor har vi vret srdeles godt tilfreds. Derfor faldt valget ogs p Virginian Suites, da vi p tilbagevejen p vores rejse skulle finde logi for de sidste 2 dage.	5.0
It is close to resturants and stores.Great hotel and activities. They think of everything. Customer service is absolutly great. Room has coffee maker and the coffee they provide is starbucks. we will difinitly be back in our future trip. Thank you!	5.0
First it looks like something happen in the beach and a bunch of dead fish are laying on the sand, as soon as the sun comes out the smell is extremely bad. Secondly the rooms are set not to allow the AC to lower below 70 that made the room uncomfortable and third we where in the room for three days and the minibar wasn't re-stocked or was the sugars for the coffee maker or tea, it looks like only one elevator was working and it took forever!	3.0
This hotel is super!!The staff is friendly, and very competent. The room was spacious, and clean, and the bed comfortable. The location is good, and there is a restaurant around the corner. Very quiet.	5.0
I don't normally write bad reviews unless I was extremely unhappy with the experience hence this rating. This is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.

We had no tv service and was told we could move or we could be taken care when we checked out.. we chose to stay in the room as we where unpacked , it was late and we were ready for bed. When we checked out we where then told we had to talk to the manager as we booked thru expedia. It took over week to track the manager down (i left at least three messages on her voicemail). Only to be told that their policy was to move us ... she was rude in her dealing with the situation...thats not what we where told at the time...when I pushed it i was given the option of 10 off my next stay..also ...it was a long weekend and the hotel was busy ... the breakfast area needed attended to...food running out and a little cleaning was in order...the front desk person was friendly and did her best to replenish and a very bus time for her at the desk...when i asked housekeeping for a new ice bucket (as ours had a crack in it and was leaking) she rolled her eyes at me and sighed like i was putting her out... this hotel could use some renovatons and attention in order to be up to Ramada standard. P.S. I fly alot and have used this hotel at least 3 or 4 times .... there will not be another stay there. and not recommending it.	1.0
Imagine our disgust when we woke the following morning and found that the bed sheets had stains all over them.  If the hotels do nothing else, they should make absolutely certain their housekeeping staff is top notch and that they actually clean a room and change the bedding.  There were also dead insects on the floor of the bathroom.  I now know why this hotel had rooms available while everyone else was sold out.	2.0

Nice location along the same road as the Marriott, which gives you convenient dining and bar options.

A really mixed bag. Great location (by Space Needle campus) and very nice rooms.

The view out the back is truly horrifying ... a crack house with squatters... but no spillover to the hotel. Lots of good restaurants... More	3.0
Outstanding hotel. Stayed in a huge suite at a good price. Hotel and room were very clean. Room was quiet, no noise from the hall or other rooms. Excellent service: valet, bellman, room service, front desk. Front desk had two cribs in our room before our arrival. At most hotels, we have to call two or three times after arrival to get cribs delivered, no matter how often we have requested them ahead of time. Only issue: pool was not heated as much as needed.	5.0
housekeeping staff said some very rude ugly words when we weren't ready to check out at 8:50 am !!! check out time is supposed to be at 11 am. everything else was awesome and everyone else was also awesome !	3.0
We moved to this hotel after a really bad experience at the Adam's Mark a few miles up the street. It was clean comfortable. The breakfast was very good and the meeting/eating space is great for a group! We also liked that we could walk to multiple restaurants and that it's centrally located.	4.0
My wife and I would definitely not recommend this hotel. It was over priced, noisy, and not clean. The only accommodating person was the breakfast attendant. The rates go up a ridiculous amount during the week.	1.0

I was attending a conference at the River Hotel (January 30-31, 2016). This was purely business so I wanted to minimize my stress by staying at (or near) the conference location by being able to fly in, then shuttle to from O'Hare airport and yet have plenty of dining options within walking distance of the hotel. The River Hotel found me a small room for a VERY reasonable (unbelievable) rate. Yes, I have read the reviews about the small rooms. This one was small. There was one queen sized bed, a desk, a pull out work station, and a full (shower) bath. Period. No extras. Yet it met MY needs (listed above) and my usual criteria of CLEAN, COMFORTABLE, and SAFE. The staff was EXCELLENT. I received friendly, efficient 5 star service for a 3 star price - from every single employee shift - both day night. I received free bottled water from a water station in the hallway. The vending machines were reasonable. My 17th floor small room, overlooked the river, the Trump Tower, the River Walk, and the city lights and sounds only added to the ambiance. I took the elevator down, crossed the lobby, took another elevator up to the conference (the two elevators - activated only by your room key card - ensured that the guest rooms were secure from being accessed by non guests). Even the conference was well prepped and attended by the hotel staff with fresh coffee, tea, and complimentary sodas that were refreshed at every break. I could continue... But suffice it to say that I was IMPRESSED. YES. My room was small. However, the break in price was compensation for this and (since I was only needing work space sleep) I did not NEED more. That said, if I am ever in Chicago again - for work or vacation - I WILL be back. NOTE: The hotel has an on site Italian Restaurant called Bella Bacinos. I will review it separately. For now, suffice it to say the food was DELICIOUS, the service was also 5 star, and the price - while not as inexpensive as I am accustomed to - was as affordable (more so) than comparable places nearby. Just be aware that a small is a medium... a medium is a large... etc. Yum!Dear John S,Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for your detailed review of your experience.We are so proud of our staff services as well as our prime location and are delighted you were pleased as well. There is nothing I like more than sharing great comments with the team and I will certainly pass along your kind words.We are beyond thrilled to know we are your hotel of choice when visiting Chicago. We will look forward to welcoming you back soon!	5.0
We stayed at the Shore hotel two months ago, the hotel exceeded our expectations. We stayed in an Ocean-view Premier room which offered us a view of the pool and ocean.

We took our two kids to stay at this hotel and we had so many undesireable problems during our one night stay, it really ruined the trip. My kids and I got stuck in the elevator which scared my kids to death and they were afraid to get back on the elevator. This was a problem since our room was on the 27th floor. We ordered desert from room service and only got half of what was supposed to come with it and the guy acted put out when I asked him to go and get the rest of the order. The jets on the hot tub were not working, the steam room was not working, and the room with the pool was all gross and really worn down. Our blankets had stains on them in the room and the toilet ran for 45 minutes after flushing which was really loud throughout the room. Housekeeping came and knocked on the door at 8am even though we had the do not disturb sign out. For a four star hotel it lacks the amenities you would expect. Internet was extra and we had to pay $15/day to park. The only good thing was the location and the view was great! Other than that, a huge dissappointment and not worth the money! The worst part was that no one even cared to ask about my stay when we checked out...	2.0

Bad: We had a ground unit and was unable to sleep until 11 pm every night because of the family above us had a kid that ran from 7 am to 11 pm for 3 nights.

We appreciated our rest after a very busy day. The bed was very comfortable. The staff in the bar area was also congenial and helpful with a late meal.

We loved our room at Wyndham Canterbury! It included a small kitchenette with a dining table, a sitting area, and a separate bedroom. While there were only two of us, we certainly enjoyed the extra space. This would be a great place for a small family!

The only negative thing I have to say is that when our room was cleaned & new condiments where left for us, not everything was replenished. But that is a very minor thing so I would say the overall stay/service was exceptional.	5.0
The hotel itself wasn't bad. The location worked for my purpose and the lobby was clean, staff friendly, etc. my room was a bit on the gross side. The couch had stains on it, the rug by the bathroom looked like someone missed and in the morning the toilet backed up, confirming my impression of the rug stains. I couldn't wait to get to the next stop so I could feel clean again!	3.0

I have stayed for New Year's Holiday.I was looking forward to visiting this hotel very very much. and I requested to them that I would like a high floor at their web site while reservation. as a result,my timeline on arrival day is following.11:30 arrival at Hotel,and deposit luggage. the representative of reception saidWe accept your request. at this time.15:45 Challenge for the first check-in. But the another representative told me that Check-intime start from 16:00.16:00 2nd challenge to check-in. new another representative said the inspection of your room hasn't complete yet. wait for several minute the long line made by waiting check-in people were appeared from this time. 16:15 3rd challenge to check-in. next another representative said the inspection isn't yet.wait for 5-10min. I answered OK,I wait for at here(front desk) the long line has become much longer.16:50 4th challenge to check-in. no one tell me anything.I try to talk to another person who stand the next of front desk I am waiting for 45 minutes,Whyto tell you the truth,I had expected this time a little.because I thought this waiting time was the time to find the highfloor room I requested. 17:00 check-in done.the room assigned to me was...the most lowest floor(3rd).there are 20 floors in this hotel and I had requested higher floorsince 2 month ago,But the answer was the most lowest level.I was so sad...so sad. the attached picture is the View from this room.If the assigned floor was 4th floor,I think I was saved from this sadness.But 3rd...the most lowest floor to the guest who request high floor.I know this season is very busy.I don't want to complain more than that.The hospitality and smile of their staffs were very good.I'll stay this hotel again.maybe this month.Dear 376masatot, Thank you very much for feedback about your recent stay with us. I am terribly sorry to hear about your arrival experience and that your request for a room on a high floor could not be fulfilled. This is definitely not a typical St. Regis experience and on behalf of the entire team I would like to sincerely apologize. We would love for an opportunity to welcome you back to our hotel and show you our true five star service, so please do not hesitate to contact me directly at Melanie.rehbeinstregis.com for anything I may assist with.

Booked a room at the last minute - sight unseen. How refreshing to see a hotel in a nice setting, but close to Route 93 and Boston. The front desk personnel, condition of the room and, can you belive it - a hotel breakfast was over the top. This is my first choice for hotels north of Boston.	5.0
The price was really good, but I was disappointed when I checked in and they did not have the room I booked. I booked a king and all they could give me was two doubles. They said I could move the next day, but I decided to stay in my same room rather than packing everything back up again. The room was definitely in need of some maintenance, but nothing major. I would stay there again, as long as I get the room I actually book next time.	3.0
Spacious and clean room. Very comfortable and firm bed with down pillows and comforter. We had no problem connecting to the free WiFi. Little luxuries in the room included a Keurig machine, k-cups and a mini fridge. We arrived after 1:00 AM and someone was still at the front desk to greet us. There is a nice little area next to the front desk where they sell snacks, drinks (including beer) and basic toiletry items. The indoor pool is open 6:00am - 11:00pm - didn't get to experience it but it looked very nice - there is also a hot tub. Made reservation for a smoking room however, the entire building is smoke free FYI. There is breakfast served next to the lobby area in the morning - there is a continental breakfast (6.95) or a breakfast buffet (9.95). We had the buffet and it was very good - you can order custom omelets and they had biscuits, sausage gravy, bacon, sausage, grits and eggs all hot and ready. There is also milk, juice, and soda available. We also liked the late check-out time (12 noon) since we got in so late. We would definitely stay here again - overall, very happy we picked this hotel!	4.0

Good parking lot size at hotel - no problems finding a spot for me. Hotel had a Tues night guest reception which was well attended the night I went...had food and drinks there. Hotel is older, but very clean. Front desk and all of staff was very accomodating and pleasant. Room was like an apt in size/good kitchen set up. I extended my stay for 2 extra nights. I felt very safe for a single woman traveler. Would probably be a good place to stay for families or groups as well.	5.0
I booked this hotel for a concert I was taking my teenager to. The room had cracked and nailed badly crown molding. the area close around the bed had not been vacuumed in quite some time.

My friend and I selected this hotel for the extra room provided--a nice living room area that included a great flat-screen TV, small frig, microwave and sink. An ironing board and iron provided the ability to have our clothes look freshly pressed each day, the bathroom was beautiful and clean and the bed was very comfortable! (Great TV in the bedroom also). The made to order breakfast each day was of good quality and service was warm and friendly the evening drinks and snacks were great also. Maid service kept our room spotless! There isn't anything I could recommend that would have added to our hotel experience--I will definitely look for an Embassy Suites everywhere I go!	5.0
The hotel itself is older and the rooms need a few updates . The lobby/pool area is awesome!!!! Great play areas for older and younger kids. Air conditioner super noisy. Beds were very comfy. Great value .	4.0
Dirty hotel with questionable people living in the hotel.	1.0
Good: Lovely helpful staff	5.0
Good for its purpose which was to stay there only long enough to sleep. Fan in room was so loud that we had to shut the air off for the night. Lots of road noise. The breakfast was good with lots of options and great service by the folks managing it.	3.0
The rooms need some updating. The bathroom was very small and the exhaust fan was very loud in the bathroom.	3.0
We had a great stay. Had to stay at this hotel after checking into and out of a different hotel due to issues at the property. We should have just found this hotel first and stayed here. Front desk staff was very nice. Breakfast attendant could have been a little sunnier. We would stay at this property if ever back... More	5.0
In town for the US Open it was a bit noisy the night the Penguins won the cup but it was a comfortable room with quick room service. The only negative was I had waived room service for the first day and the maid service never showed up all week- i had to call to get them to clean.	4.0
Check in process went very smooth, Romano was very friendly and had a lot to offer as far as getting into DC and things to do. The room was clean, beds made nicely, bathroom was a bit small and only 2 large towels so we had to ask house keeping for more, the on duty house keeper didn't speak very... More	5.0
Staff is friendly, Hotel is Clean and very comfortable. They offer breakfast and chocolate chip cookies! What more do you need. This place has a fitness center and a pool. I stay here for business and I never choose another hotel. Would Highly Recommend.	5.0
Was looking for a quite hotel off the strip and it totally fit. Property and room were average, but very clean and quiet. Staff was great. Food at their caf was very good. Convenient to use monorail, station was just across the road.	3.0
Bad: Nothing. Good: Convenient to airport, great staff, lovely decor.	5.0
I was very surprised by how modern the hotel was. I heard stories that the hotel wasn't up to par but I found it to be very nice and clean. I would stay again.	4.0
Everyone is so nice and accommodating and they went out of their way to be sure everything was satisfactory. The location is great for attending the Masters Golf Tournament. We've been staying there since it first opened.	5.0
This was my second stay with a Ramada branded hotel. I had such high hopes for our stay since the previous Ramada we stayed with was such a good experience, unfortunately I cannot say the same for this stay. At check in the desk clerk was in my opinion very ill mannered almost rude like she wanted to hurry us... More	2.0
I requested a smoking room because my hubby likes cigars and was pleasantly surprised by how fresh the room was! I've stayed in higher-end hotels and the hallways and rooms reeked where smoking was allowed! That was not the case at Extended Stay. Admittedly, it's not the most modern hotel, but it was comfortable, staff was friendly, and it was well-kept. My only minor complaint is that you have to request kitchen amenities. By the time I knew that they weren't in the cabinets, it was late and I didn't feel like bothering to request any.	4.0
Bad: I as if I could use my AARP OR AAA card for a discount on my room, question was never answered, got the run around from one person to another. I ask also on line during booking the room.	4.0
Ok experience nothing special except when the power went out in the morning and stayed out for a few minutes.	3.0
Bad: There were a couple younger staff at the desk during mid day times that seemed bothered by questions. Good: Easy to park. The room was clean and cool. Valet staff was really nice. Steve the maintence man was amazing. I dropped my pearl earring down the bathroom sink. He took the time to take the loop of the drain and get my pearl earring back. I was grateful for his extra service and care.	4.0
Very horrible customer service at the beginning of our stay and during our stay, We are.very disappointed with this hotel. The walls are paper thin. The customer service rep hung up on me as I was describing how loud the guest was next door.	1.0
Awesome resort! We are always pleased with the staff and the rooms. One of the best resort beaches in Lahaina. Great beach entry for kids and the pool has plenty to keep the kids happy. We have stayed at this resort 4 times and will continue in the future.	5.0
With all the other choices in the area, I'll stay somewhere else next time. This is the 1st Embasy Suites I won't stay at again. It doesn't appear that they care about the upkeep of the hotel and as a non-smoker, I wasn't impressed with the smoke everywhere! I DID receive the non-smoking room I reserved...Too bad it wasn't smoke-free...because the room REEKED!!	3.0
AC is central but controlled in office in blocks of 10 rooms. So if you are hot, they will turn it on, and if someone else complains they are cold, they turn it off. Craziest system I ever heard of. I was able to switch to a room with a window AC, but it was barely adequate to cool on... More	3.0
In heart of downtown. Older hotel with front steps that you needed to have bell service for. Breakfast good but expensive. Parking nearby for a fee. Free coffee am only. needs grab bars in bath.	4.0
Bad: Difficult to reach reservation staff (no tollfree number, nobody answering phone during business hours, long waits on hold), inflexibility in changing a reservation a week in advance, not enough towels, toilet too low and tub too high. A bit pricey... Good: Location, quality of free toiletries	3.0
Wat een desolate toestand. Achterstallig onderhoud in het kwadraat in een desolate omgeving. Vieze lucht als je binnenkomt. Tijdens verblijf nog brand op een andere verdieping, geen noodplan geen enkele coordinatie. Risicovol om daar te slapen!! Het eten was zeer slecht!	1.0
Our stay was mediocre at best! There is CHELSEA and Chelsea ANNEX. We had the ANNEX, and it was in poor condition. Furniture was far from nice, front desk and lobby gave you a very good first impression. The people at the desk were nice. One block from the beach, which was huge for me. Paid parking at 10 a day in a lot about 1.5 blocks away, or, 15 a day got valet. The elevator was very rough to ride. There was a small, but nice, pool. No coffee maker, no microwave, no mini-frig, ices machine did not work very well. Out air conditioning was set at 50* and it was so hot in there, especially for sleeping. The maintenance man said it couldn't get any cooler because it ran on cold water, and the water wasn't cold! If you are in AC to gamble, or go to the beach, this is fine to use the beaten down bathroom, or lay your head on a pillow. We won't be guests here again!	2.0
I lost my confirmation number and they couldn't find my reservation, but they gave me a room I booked at the price I was quoted at. Breakfast was good and restaurant area was clean. Housekeeping was great and on cue. Came back to a clean room and fresh towels every day.	4.0
We come to the Dells every summer. We look to stay places downtown off the beaten path of the resorts. Indian Trail was excellent! Pool and grilling area were great. My husband and I loved playing shuffleboard and badminton on property with the kids. There was a nice wooded area to walk around in evening. Also the morning of our... More	5.0
If you are looking for a comfortable beach front location, it does not get much better than this. You would have to rent a private home to find anything comparable on Captiva.

This hotel had an ant problem, was extremely loud, we found hair on our towels, and someone else was given the key to our room at midnight. NEVER AGAIN! We stayed at several Best Westerns on our vacation, this was by far the WORST.	1.0
This was just an OK place to spend a night since it was close to our destination and was fairly inexpensive. You can tell it was an older hotel that has been renovated. Room was cleaned, but smelled of air freshener, probably to hide a smoke smell. Just didn't have that usual new Best Western feeling.	3.0
The room is large with a good,view of LA.The bed is fairly comfortable and there is plenty of seating available.Bathroom very modern with large soaking bath and a good shower.However the room lacks any character whatsoever.The inclusive breakfast does not allow any flexibility and even if you pay 20 gratuity plus room delivery charge they wont allow it. What is... More	3.0
Clean and nicely appointed. Rooms are a good size and up to date .. Breakfast is hot with plenty of food that you would expect to see. with a nice cheerful and clean eating area.

Stayed three nights on the way back to Phoenix Airport at the end of our holiday.The rooms were roomy clean but three light fittings didn't work, and neither did the TV remote.The pool was closed for one day when an underwater light fitting loosened and floated to the top of the water with electrical cables attached to the mains!!When visiting the breakfast area at 9.20am one morning, vitually nothing was left and it wasn't replenished. We had cereal and toast and that was it!!The redeeming feature at this hotel was Anthony on front desk. He was extremely welcoming, friendly and made us feel at home. I would stay there again because of the service given to us by him.	4.0
We have come to this hotel yearly for 23 years. It's convenient, friendly and has above average amenities. We recommend it especially for families. All rooms are two room suites which gives parents an opportunity to separate awhile from children. All rooms have a view of the Chesapeake Bay and balconies.	4.0
It's a newer hotel. Not much to comment on. Staff was especially friendly from the front desk to the food servers. Room was nice. Quiet sleep and everything is pretty new of course. Would stay here again for sure. Right off i55 and easy access.	5.0
The clerk asked me to make a reservation for my associate through Trip Advisor. Saved 35 Thanks Trip Advisor.

He said the breakfast was tasty and he... More	3.0

This is a completely standard mid range chain hotel with nothing more to add except that the bed and the bed linen were noticeably better than I would expect. Apparently I have to write more for this to qualify, but there's nothing to add. I think the Gym was OK, but they're all the same after a while. But the... More	3.0
It was a pleasure to end up at the Hyatt Place Atlanta Airport South after staying at 2 different properties near the airport. Friendly staff, clean facilities, and room, comforatable bed.

I understand these cabins are 75 years old so I didn't expect to walk into a 5 star facility but I did expect it to be clean, even somewhat clean would have been nice. The shower had not been cleaned AT ALL, the commode was not flushed, one bed had hair in it, the other bed had dirt in it,... More	1.0
Stayed there well in town for a wedding. The front desk people were helpful. The little Lounge stayed open quite late which was a nice surprise. I would stay there again.	4.0
This hotel is close to the Willis tower and millennium park. If your happy to walk navy pier is about 30 mins away. This hotel is on Adams street which is also the start of route 66. The hotel itself is clean comfortable and the staff are friendly. The room was cleaned daily and extra pillows were provided on request. There is free washing and ironing facilities along with chilled water and ice machines located on each floor. Our room had a fridge and microwave and basic kitchen supplies. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.Dear Louise RIt was great to read that you would stay with us again - what better compliment could you offer !Glad that you enjoyed the many complimentary amenities that we offer and the secret is always to ask if you need anything - we are there to look after you and will do anything to make sure your stay is comfortable and enjoyable .Kind regardsPaul Tiernan - Hotel MAnager	4.0
First of all, the owner manager both are very rude. The room I stayed in was not that clean when I first checked in. There was and probably still is writing on the walls. Not only that, but there are a lot of cockroaches, semi-torn carpet, and the walls have black fingerprints that look like they have been there... More	2.0
Even though Chris and Sheri were out of town during our stay, they made arrangements for my family and I. The lake is so peaceful - the cabins are all located off a small dead end of the lake, so there is little boat traffic. The docks were appropriately maintained. We didn't rent a boat, but there are a few... More	5.0
Our stay was very bad . It started off with waiting to check in for an hour. Then when we got to our room our bed sheets had a whole in it and not to mention our Toilet would not flush . When I went down to complain about it the front deal receptionist had an attitude . For Over 200 a night I would expect to be treated better and the hotel to be updated . I would never ever say here again .	1.0
We stayed here to go to the Legoland Discovery Center. The hotel provides free transportation to Phipps Plaza and complimentary breakfast so that was great. I would recommend this hotel for families. It's clean and the staff is amazing.	3.0
The room was nice. Didn't care much for the set up though. My kids slept on a sofa bed while I slept on the King. We couldn't watch the tv. You had to swivel it one way or another. There was a long table that divided the room from sitting to bed. The pool was small and very cold. Definitely not heated!	4.0
My wife and I love visiting LA, and just got back from a trip we took with friends.

Good hotel if you need to be in town and the area for business. Not a choice if you want to stay for pure leisure purposes. Very comfortable basic rooms with all you need. Good beds. Clean. Well maintained new hotel. Staff is helpful. Hotel has a bar and healthfood oriented bistro/snack area.	4.0
The motel is apparently very popular with cruise and airport travellers thus the staff quite often struggle with crowds queuing at a time. In which they do their best to make all the guests feel comfortable. However, sometimes it is simply impossible. So whenever you want to ask anything at the office it is better to call than to wait... More	3.0
We have driven through Grants Pass, OR several times.

Bad: I needed directions on how to work the shower -took forever to figure out how to get hot water. Good: Close enough to Ocean Drive to walk but far enough off that you didn't have to fight to get into the hotel from the street. Couldn't hear street noise. Comfortable room and great staff.	5.0
Room/hotel was not in great condition. Housekeeping left a note on first morning saying they had not cleaned the room because they were protecting our privacy - and we did not have a DND sign out, nor were we in our room late. Free WiFi was only free because it never worked. Breakfast food wasn't refilled - and there was still 30 min remaining.	2.0
The staff was courteous, the hotel was right off the highway and close to good dining options, as well as a gas station, but quiet. The neighbourhood is decent and pleasant to walk around. The waterslide is fantastic, and there were several good and hot breakfast options. They were mindful of our online requests, though I made reservations far in... More	5.0

This Residence Inn is kind of out of no where - it's pretty far from the center of city and has lots developments in the area. That being said, there are good restaurants/coffeeshops around within 3-5 mins drive. Their price for the room in summer is GREAT! Not sure if I would pay for what they ask for in spring though.Dear Jui-Yu C,Thank you for choosing the Residence Inn Phoenix North/Happy Valley for your recent travels to Phoenix. Commitment to service and guest satisfaction is a main focus and we are delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay.

From the time we walked in and greeted by Frank we knew it was going to be an amazing place. Frank gave us some local tips and Ed escorted us to our beautiful room making sure we had everything we needed, bringing us extra water and suggesting places to eat. We were there for 2 amazing nights, shame we didn't take as much advantage as we could have being.located in the shopping plaza..... So so many shops. Courteous, friendly staff. Service impeccable, in fact we rushed in after a full day had a quick shower before meeting friends, returned and found fresh towels! Amazing	5.0

My husband and I really enjoyed our stay here! It is mostly an average hotel, even a little run down in areas. BUT the incredible service (particularly from the Valet Parking staff) and close proximity to the Inner Harbor totally made up for all that. Highly recommend using their Valet service, the guys were very helpful and accommodating...they even let us keep our car there after we checked out and locked our luggage in the storage room at no extra charge! Not sure if this is part of their regular service, but we were sure happy with the arrangement! The beds were soft and super comfy, room was clean and relatively quiet from downtown noise, showers were hot with good pressure and breakfast the next day was decent. A solid choice for anyone on a budget wanting to be close to downtown!	4.0
Bad: Breakfast consisted of too much carbs (i.e. mainly bread, pastries and cakes), with no non-dairy options. Also the inability to use the stairs between floors without getting locked out!. Good: Location was great for the business conference and also shopping. The staff were friendly and always willing to help.	4.0

Very helpful staff at check in. Stayed in room 201. Had some fairly stompy people in the building, which you could hear quite a bit. Solved this by running the fan all night wasn't a problem anymore.

This is the hotel if you're just needing a place to stay in Traverse City and do not need lake front property. Rooms were clean and comfortable.

I will definitely stay here again if I visit Traverse City.	5.0

I checked in to the hotel greeted with a smile, which was good. Mind you the concierge was a little chatty. But that may just be me since I was exhausted coming in. When I went in to the room, it was stuffy even with the AC on. Which was really, really loud. I could not sleep. And if I turn down the AC, it was too hot. Opening the window, there was too much noise from the traffic outside. It was close to the highway and it was impossible to drive out of the lot without having to make a U-turn somewhere first. The bathroom was moldy. The breakfast was bad. The coffee was horrible. All in all, I had to check out after 1 night of my 5 night stay and checked in at a different hotel altogether. I was not happy.	2.0

Wow! I really can't say enough about this hotel, it was pure luxury in a beautiful setting. We spent 5 days (4 nights) at the Bardessono while visiting Napa Valley and I don't think I could ever go back without staying here again, I'm positive I'd just wish I was there instead. When you check in the valet was extremely... More	5.0
This is built for an extended type of stay. They have a kitchen area, large refrig, microwave. A 12 cup coffee pot. Nice size room. It's clean and pretty new, but nothing special. It was built and is maintained for value and it delivers. Not a bad thing at all, just understand that's how this hotel operates. There is no... More	3.0
My wife and I flew in for the big game (UNC vs DUKE) to find that we arrived to early for check in.

I was very happy. We needed dinner and a quick night's sleep. The area was great and we had many choices for food. Kind of odd there are no glasses in the room, just two foam coffee cups.	5.0
Very nice Hampton. We had a King suite on the first floor. It is the newer style Hampton rooms. Very large and spacious. Close to restaurants. Walmart nearby.

We stayed overnight to prepare for my daughter's bridal shower. Having a full size refrig was great for storing all the cold food needed for brunch. The room was clean, quiet and smelled great. Easy check in. Would definitely stay here again.	5.0

Spent 9 days at Embassy Suites while visiting family and sight-seeing. Short walk to Metro and access to all areas of DC made sight-seeing easy. Appreciated the full breakfast every morning and evening happy hour at end of day. Bed was comfortable room was clean and quiet small kitchenette was useful. Hotel shuttle to area restaurants also appreciated.	5.0
We check in at 10 pm and the AC on the room was broken then we find out that no water at the hotel. They chenge the room for us but with out water untill 3 am. The pillows and matress are terrible.	2.0
Bad: Couldn't accept my prepaid credit card so had to pay cash, walking round with large sums of cash, even just across the road, didn't make me feel particularly safe. Good: Great restaurant downstairs, room clean and modern, shower was like standing under a waterfall.	5.0
Always a pleasure to stay here . Great service . Clean rooms . Great down town location . Enjoy the early breakfast . Really enjoy the bacon . check in is speedy and pleasant - like the evening warm cookies and milk . Enjoy my 4:30 am news paper	5.0

I have visited Chicago often in the past and always have booked a different hotel.I am glad I changed this time and booked The River Hotel in Chicago.I was pleasantly greeted by a clean crisp modern room that offered plenty of space. I must also add that this is a green Hotel with lots of Green features built in.Some of the details of our stay included:Security system that only allows guests of that floor to enter that floor.Purified water provided at each floor.A coffee pot in the main room.... Not in the bathroom.A refrigerator and microwave.Luxury comforter.Comfortable chair that folds out into single bed.A greeting welcoming us on the voice mail system. A greeting giving us details about Sunday and late checkout.Available Ipads for guest use.The toiletries/ shampoo / lotion is high quality.The staff was friendly on checkout and there were no extra charges.This hotel provides a great room at a good price.Give this hotel a try!	5.0
Traveling with two kids under 7. Hotel room was spacious with a full kitchen. Not the newest place, small bathroom but overall excellent for kids.	4.0
Our visit to Bricktown was wonderful. From the time we arrived at the hotel and throughout our visit everyone was extraordinarily welcoming. They really made us feel they were glad we were there. Location of the hotel is perfect to experience the excitement of the Riverwalk. This is definitely a place we will visit again.	5.0
Thank you Erik for taking care of my friends and I! You made sure everything was taken care of the whole day and even gave us a few places to visit while we're here! The pool was super clean along with the rooms and we have so much fun so far:) we will definitely be returning :) thanks again Erik!	5.0
In the event you are trying to beat Atlanta traffic for one night, staying at a Hampton Inn by Hilton is the perfect choice. It gave me the opportunity to get to doing a important personal task without worries about think about my normal long commute.	4.0
The Warwick is clean, quiet, professional and has all the amenities. We were greeted quickly and warmly and provided with great advice about where to eat, and local knowledge re Seattle attractions.

Hotel was nice. Had to ask for towels. Room were cleaned late in day. Came back from beach and no clean towels. Wifi cost extra, parking was 35/day to hand them my keys. No complimentary breakfast. Not a 4 star experience. Stayed at a Marriott last year, much better	3.0
Bad: There is no longer a casino on the hotel grounds which is unfortunate. Also, the pool is a bit small. You have to battle to find a spot with the lounge chairs at times. Good: The rooms were clean and staff was nice. The parking is free and it is about 1 1/2 blocks from the strip. It is on the north side of the Bally's.	3.0
I highly recommend this hotel! I wanted a modern hotel that didn't look like most of the San Fransisco historic hotels. PROS: Clean. Beautiful. Great views. Perfect location. Friendly Staff. Affordable prices. Floor to ceiling windows! Bathtub. CONS: I couldn't find any cons!	5.0

My wife and I had a very nice time in Waikiki. We wanted to have a good time and not spend too much money. We booked a standard room at the Ocean Tower Hotel. Renovations are going on now to upgrade all the rooms. Our first room was clean and met our needs. But one night we had a small problem with a sprinkler in our room. To take care of the problem we were given a deluxe ocean view room for the same price. This made the vacation so much nicer, getting up in the morning and looking at the ocean. I have Leonor Wong to thank for this and many other things she did to make are stay so nice. When we go back to Waikiki we will stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel.	5.0

For a very small town out in the middle of nowhere, you will not find anything better. In fact, it is above average, even compared with its big city counterparts. Clean, well-maintained and comfortable. That's all we ask. The breakfast was the weakest link, but that has become standard for pretty much every place that offers the routine continental fare.	4.0
Hotel was easy to find. I could see the top of Mt Rainier out our window. Room was clean and comfortable. Front desk staff were polite and very helpful (to the hotel: I did find my glasses sun clip that I thought I lost in the car but thank you for keeping an eye out for them!!). The two gals... More	5.0
Room was too expensive. No full or continental breakfast. Staff a bit laid back. Breakfast was offered on site, but you paid for it.

Shower was very hard to turn on and I had to... More	3.0
Stayed here for one night. Saw suspicious people hanging out in the parking lot by the pool area. We arrived late at night. They were dressed with baggy clothes with pants hanging down their bottom.

My wife and I spent three days at the Cub while we hiked in the park. It is off the beaten path and away from the crazy traffic and prices of Gatlinburg. It's like staying at Moms house.

Open plaza design of this Marriott makes it unique. Since it was late Oct when we stayed, it was beginning to get cold, but we were in a room inside a doorway so we didn't have the colder weather right outside our door. We had our own car to drive to Old Town, but they do offer a shuttle to... More	4.0
Bad: Rooms with connecting doors can be very noise due to poor noise control of these doors. Good: Great location, very friendly staff, great vibe	5.0
This was a very pleasant resort. We were only able to stay one night, but would have loved to stay longer. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and the rooms were clean and comfortable. Excellent choice, and pet friendly!	5.0
Room was dirty to the point of trash under beds and dirty socks behind dresser. Mold in bathroom and kitchen area. At one point came back from visiting family to discover the door to the room open when I know it was locked when I left. Needless to say will not stay here ever again..	1.0
Nice stay, clean rooms. Right off the 15 fwy. The staff gave us the 2 rooms we requested next to each other. They were comfortable. The continental breakfast was sufficient. Walking distance to Peggy Sues diner. (Not affiliated with the one off the I-15 near Barstow).	4.0

Me and my partner stayed at the Motel 6 Downtown Atlanta beginning of september 2015. We were visiting Atlanta for a couple days as we were on route to Fort Lauderdale and slept 2 night at the Motel 6.The Motel 6 is excellent value for money! Rooms are clean with a nice bathroom. Our room also had a small balcony where you can relax in the morning and evenings when it is not to hot outside...Check in staff was very polite and check in went very smooth. Also a plus is that you can get free coffee at the reception area every morning from about 7am. That is very easy when you arrive 'jet laged' from Europe and wake up much to early each morning -)Location of the Motel 6 is perfect because you can do all the tourist places like the Coca Cola museum, the Olypic parc etc by foot.They also have a car park at site at no extra cost, so that was also very easy to park our rental car there.Overal the Motel 6 downtown is a basic but very good motel in downtown Atlanta with clean rooms and friendly staff. I will surely stay here again when visiting Atlanta!	4.0

This hotel badly needs updating. The first room the faucet didn't work, the room they moved us to you couldn't open the door, the next room had two double beds instead of a king which I had reserved. I was very disappointed in this Comfort Suites! We usually have good luck with Comfort Suites but not this one. Wouldn't stay... More	1.0
The walls between rooms are paper thin. Lots of noise if the room next door is occupied. Not too much light in the bathroom. A $10.00 cab ride away from the historic district downtown. The maids did not clean the room very well. Trash cans were not emptied. Heard they discharged part of the hotel staff. The lobby and breakfast were good.  An older hotel. I think, after this, I will bypass Holiday Inn Express hotels for a while.	2.0
Comfortable beds, clean rooms and friendly staff. We missed the continental breakfast but grabbed some fruit and coffee before we left. The pool area is nice for kids with a mini water park. We went down to the hot tub after 10 pm and had the place to ourselves.	4.0
Bad: There is handicap parking for checking in but not close after checking in. Good: Everything was convenient and costs of the buffet were not bad. Prices in the restaurant were affordable.	5.0
Our stay was short but convenient for what we had planned. The price was great. My only negative would be that I was not allowed to accumulate Wyndham points, because I used a booking agent.	4.0

I have stayed at this hotel several times and every time something little was wrong but we overlooked it.

It seems like the hotel is still undergoing renovations and that everything is not quite finished yet. However, I think it will be nice once finished. They do have more modern furnishings in the room like plasma tv, and computer hookups.	4.0
Bad: nil. Good: Good place if you don't want to be directly on the strip. Large rooms, clean and renovate, which is not always the case in Las Vegas. Perfect breakfast and very gooid service.	5.0
Embassy Suites are always beautiful, open spaces and comfortable rooms. This one, across the river from the National Mall, didn't disappoint in it's appearance and cleanliness. But I'm confused why the room service policy doesn't include timely pick-up of used dishes. We saw numerous trays of dirty dinner dishes on the hallway floors 12 to 15 hours after delivery. Seems it would be much cleaner and less (potential) bug-attracting to collect those dishes early in the morning, before breakfast is served. This issue seemed tacky to me, its the kind of thing guests shouldn't have an opportunity to observe. Instead, guests can't help but walk past lots of dirty dishes on their way to breakfast. Equally, dining room staff needs to be sufficient to keep the tables clean at the same rate of guest arriving for breakfast...or at least give us a place near the kitchen to bus our own trays! I saw lots of folks trying to find a clean table, while lots of other folks were trying to clean up after themselves. Aside from this issue, the staff bent over backwards for every question, request or incident.	4.0
What a great beautiful day to spend doing what I love most, which is laying on the beach and reading a book! Today, I went down to the beach by myself (which is rare) to enjoy a great book while I listen to the waves. It was extra special as I was greeted by Jake on the way to the... More	5.0
I was a little worried when I saw the outside of Bricktown Hotel and Convention Center however, the inside has been beautifully redone and is absolutely wonderful! We will definitely stay here again. We stayed one night for the Thunder vs. Spurs game. Bricktown Hotel and Convention Center has free shuttle to the Arena which was a plus as we had no clue upon booking this hotel.	5.0
Good: Staff was rude to me and didn't recognize my platinum status	2.0

Expedia charged me for the room, but Hotel did not honor the reservation. HJotel sent me to expedia and expedia to hotel TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE with Expedia	1.0
When we arrived at the hotel at 4.30PM well past the check in time of 3 PM, the clerk told us that the room was not ready, could not tell how long it would be before the room would be ready. He did not explain why the room was not ready. His attitude was that it was that way and there was nothing he could do about it. We had to wait for over one hour and only when we approached the clerk and inisted on the room then only he procedded to give us a room. The next day we returned from a late breakfast at 12:05 pm and we were not able to get into our room as the card would not unlock the door.	2.0
Bad: Didn't have refrigerator. Prefer scrambled eggs to Spanish omelets. Good: Bed was comfortable.	3.0
this was our first visit to Royal Anchor. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Loved the private beach.....only steps away from the hotel. This place is kept very clean, only thing I'd change would be the pillows. But that won't keep me from coming back. Will definitely be back!	4.0

This is a really wonderful hotel! We booked two rooms for our stay. We were there at 3pm and we were able to check into only one of them because the other wasn't finished being cleaned. They were going to call us when the other room was ready. We waited around for about an hour and we finally went back in and asked. We reserved a room with a balcony- well, they didn't have one. Even after waiting for an hour, they didn't have a room for us. We stood up there waiting for about 30-45 more minutes, and they decided to give us a room with a kitchen, living room area and a fireplace in lieu of what we reserved. I have to say, they were very accommodating and we appreciated the extra space. They were very nice and did all they could to make it right- and we were very happy about our room when we finally got it!! Now, on to the free breakfast that is offered....it is amazing!!! Biscuits, white gravy, oatmeal(with all kinds of toppings to put in it!), bacon, grits, eggs, hash browns, cereal, toast, bagels(all types of cream cheese and butter and jellies), coffee, hot chocolate, apple juice, cranberry juice, orange juice and milk...there was sooooo much! This place is really kept up and clean!! We will definitely be staying here again! Thank you for such an awesome trip!!	5.0
The room was big and bed comfortable. Everything else was bad. Dirty, no hot water. Poor TV reception. Spotty wifi. Moldy hallway. Dangerous neighborhood. Bkfst only for tour groups. Faucets poor condition. Couch stained and baggy. Rug stained. Hole in door screen. Road under construction. Etc. etc.	1.0

Very nice hotel and convenient to downtown. Good size for one or two people (maybe 2 kids on the pullout). We were one of several rooms with other family members - all in the same building, nice. The breakfast was also good and they're was plenty of food for all. Jacob at the front desk was friendly and very helpful.	4.0
My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for one night for the Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington this past weekend. It was more than adequate for being a place to spend the night. We liked that the room and bathroom were spacious. The location was ideal for someone who drove to the area. I believe the hotel also has a shuttle to the nearby metro station. It is a 15-20 minute drive to Washington in regular, non-congested traffic. The breakfast buffet was standard but I would really expect much for the price we paid. I like that they have their own parking lot and they are just down the street from numerous fast food establishments and a supermarket. The gentleman at the reception desk was a bit short with us and another couple who were checking in before is but nothing that is worth complaining about. Overall I would recommend this hotel as it is a good bargain and is close to highway access and public transportation.	4.0
Everything about this hotel was excellent! Check-in and check-out were super fast and easy (I use the mobile app). Every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful.

I am extremely picky about cleanliness and beds and linens in hotels and I can say that this place has very high standards. The sheets on my bed must have been brand new.

The location was perfect -- easy to find and suited our needs for our activities while in town. Check-in was easy, people were nice, the room was clean. It's not fancy, but given the alternatives in Napa (very pricey), it suited our needs. (We had two rooms, and our relatives had a third.) There's no getting around that this is a Best Western, with Denny's as the anchor restaurant. Clean, no frills, convenient. No more, no less.Annhurst - I am pleased to hear that our hotel suited all your needs. We are thrilled you got everything you needed in your visit to Napa. Come visit us again soon.	4.0
Bad: Loved everything about Virgin Hotel. Good: First and foremost the staff - just wonderful. Friendly and very patient with all the enquiries we made!

They sprang into action for the outer doors, but saw a dad with buggy struggle to get through, and people with cases, let in through the outside door, and having to open the inner door themselves with luggage. Good: The welcome was great. Staff were helpful and interested. The room was stylish and spacious, with great facilities in the room like iPod Dock.	5.0

Sink had leak, which soaked the entire counter top. Given rags to wrap around the faucet and told that no maintenance person available. Given option to move on last night there.

I seemed like the Hotel is under going renovations. The road in front of the property is under going serious construction. One of the exterior doors to the Hotel never did not open from the outside.

The room was fine, but was very small. You could not walk around the room with a suitcase on the floor. The bags had to be on the bed to walk around and on the floor to sleep. I think the room was approximately 14 X 14 with 2 beds. Decorating and cleanliness were fine, just small.	3.0
Hotel is clean and well kept. Rooms are usual Microtel fare. Water pressure on second floor left something to be desired. Beds are very firm.

Bad: The referbishment work started before 9am each morning and seemed to be right above our room, whixh meant we didn't get much sleep at all.

Due to a computer glitch with the booking agent, the staff could not find our booking in the hotel's system. The staff was quick to accommodate and gave us a room (upgrade with no charge).

This is a good hotel for business purposes. The wi fi signal is good and it is very close to the federal reserve bank. A little too close to some of Chicago's high crime district for my taste, but we felt relatively safe. Convenient to restaurants, and decent breakfast. A solid business option.Dear Samantha HThank you for your review.I would like to reassure you that The Central Loop area of Chicago which is, as you know, also the Financial District of the City is not near any major crime area. The area is safe and very well patrolled by the Chicago Police so please do not have any concerns.I am glad you had a good stay with us and look forward to you return.Kind regardsPaul Tiernan - Hotel Manager	4.0

We enjoyed our stay at the Beast Western Royale in Pasadena. The King Suite was very clean and well appointed. They have a nice pool and spa area. There are restaurants within walking distance.

Cheap comes with a cost. You must be desperate to stay here. Drug bust the day we stayed. Nice owners but wow. Everything is old, broken, stained and smelly. Never again. It is not worth the little money they charge.	2.0
This was our first time staying at Aloft. The hotel is very clean and secure. The bed was amazing and made it hard to go out and explore. Conveniently located blocks away from the french quarter. They also give you coupons if you choose not to have your room cleaned. The Make a Green Choice program is great, especially for those of us who don't prefer our room be cleaned anyway. Thanks for the kudos, see you next time!Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations	5.0
My wife and I have stayed in several Motel 6s this year and this one is mostly average with the exception that it has a microwave and refrigerator which is a big plus.

We always stay at this hotel when visiting New Orleans.

The hotel is in very good condition, with a nearly completed renovation. Pool was nice. Breakfast was good. Miscue was that my room was assigned to another guest while assigned to me! Keys were made and given to this other guest. I was in the room when the other guest came to the room to move in.	4.0

There for a week and every day every staff member was very helpfull. They have a shuttle to the metro station and the drivers were very nice. They even gave us their cell to call them so we won't have to wait. The cleaning crew was always helful and friendy. The room was super and the beds were really good. Breakfast was good and you have the convenience of a 7eleven across the street to pack some water and snacks for the day. For shure we'll be back to this great hotel. THANK YOU!	5.0

We stayed one night here. The Naples area is very pricey. We booked a room here via a Priceline special deal for a reasonable rate. Our room was a large suite with 2 beds. The hotel is relatively new and clean. The breakfast exceeded my expectations and probably saved us an additional 35. Overall, a great value!!!!	4.0
I stayed at The Maritime Hotel on May 21-22, 2016. It is a stylishly appointed space throughout, from the lobby to the restaurant to the rooms. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful both check in and check out were a breeze. They'll hold your bags for you if your room isn't ready at the time you check in and they'll hold them for you even after you check out if your check out time is earlier than when you're finally ready to leave Chelsea. Incredibly convenient location to lots of restaurants and activities, including the Highline. The hotel is also right across the street from The Chelsea Market, which is terrific shopping experience. I highly recommend booking The Maritime if you plan to stay in the Chelsea neighborhood. The only caveat I have is bring earplugs for sleeping, or some kind of white noise generator to drown out the sound of car horns honking all night. Other than that, it was a great stay.	5.0
The lobby was very nice, but that was about it. the room was not at all what you would expect from the description. I had to deodorize the room due to a strange odor, it wasn't horrible but unpleasant. The bed was not comfortable, but was semi-clean other than a well worn sheet. The AC did work very well and the the TV was a recent upgrade, too bad the hotel only had 5 channels to choose from. Overall, I was disappointed with the room and I am thankful I only stayed a single night. I would not stay there again and probably would not stay in a hotel in the surrounding area either.	2.0

I run an event at Bedford Village every summer and this motel is my go-to favorite.

The manager uses foul language referring to poorly trained staff. Staff does not know how to issue credits after they fail to honor the rate quoted. The rooms are poorly cleaned with light bulbs burned out and never replaced. Staff consists of young children that cannot make decisions nor are mature enough to deal with challenges.	1.0
It was great ...location and very friendly and clean	5.0
Overall the stay was very good. The shuttle service was very helpful and the drivers were friendly and gave us good information on where to eat or have fun. The pool was relaxing and clean although the hot tub was way too hot. The pool has an adult time after 11:00pm but it is not monitored so the pool and hot tub had kids (both from and not from the hotel) in it at that time. Get to the pool early to get a seat as there are not many and they go fast. It was nice to use the bikes for a ride since they are free for the first 3 hours. I would return to the Hotel in the future.	4.0
Bad: Hotel should be in the motel category considering the room we've got. We had cockroaches in the bathroom and the small fridge was very noisy. Very basic breakfast canned food, nothing fresh. Definitely, it doesn't worth the price per night. Good: Friendly staff	2.0
Our experience at the Homewood Suite was very good. The hotel was very clean. The room we had was very spacious, it accommodated 4 adults 2 children and a puppy. We are very very happy in our choice to go with the Homewood Suite .. Our next trip to Virginia we will stay at the Homewood Suite.	5.0
We were looking for a quick low key weekend escape to get out of the heat, without breaking the bank, Upon arrival, staff was friendly, check in was a breeze, the hotel and grounds were excellent. Location was close to dining, shopping and nightlife. Will definitely return!	5.0
The hotel was very clean, and the staff was friendly and helpful in planning downtown activities. The location is not great, we didn't have a pretty view of anything from our room, but it was still only a quick $10 cab ride to downtown.	4.0
Bad: In my opinion, the carpet needs to be replaced or cleaned urgently. It left an unpleasant musty smell in the room. I changed the room and the smell remained. After walking barefoot on the carpet and stepping into the tub, there were black dirt tracks in the tub. I expected the rooms to be as good as the standard of the lobby, the dining area and the pool area. Good: Excellent breakfast. The outside facilities, lobby and the pool area are very good.	3.0
Bad: Beds were uncomfortable. The hotel is a lot older than what it may seem in the pictures. Good: Modern decor.	2.0
It's not a 5-star hotel. It's a Motel 6.

I was bitten by something in the room and when I brought it to the attention of the staff it was minimized by general manager.

Arriving here late at night I didn't really appreciate the beautiful surroundings until I woke up the next day, and the hotel itself was not too bad either.

Bad: The bed was very uncomfortable. Lumpy and too soft. Good: Central location. Easy check-in and out. Nice touches.

Fitness center had a variety of cardio equipment and weights.	4.0
I have no idea why this resort isn't on more people's radar. Maybe it's better that it isn't - but now you know the secret. It's located just far away from town that it feels secluded but not remote.

The hotel has an excellent location, close to several tourist attractions such as Millennium Park and The Art Institute of Chicago. The staff is really friendly! We got a check in two hours in advance.Bedroom is clean and has a good size. We asked for an extra bed and it was put in the bedroom quickly. The restroom is also good. Not fancy but comfortable and clean.There's no breakfast included, which is not a good point, but there are several restaurants nearby (Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts and others). The hotel is also close to several train stations.Wifi works well in the bedroom. The fees are not so cheap, but for that location all hotels use to be expensive, so I'd say this one offers a good cost-benefit ratio.In general it was a good experience and I'd stay there again in the future.Dear Camila LThank you very much for the review of your recent stay with us at The Central Loop HotelI am delighted that we were able to offer you good value for money and you were able to enjoy all the amenities that we offer and appreciated our great location from which to get out and see the city.I was especially delighted to read about the service we offered you - we know that these small things make all the difference.

Great location in Vail. Located right along the river. Nice heated pool and hot tub. Great customer service.	5.0
I came down for a work event, and I chose this hotel mainly for its proximity to the event site, but I ended up having dinner at the restaurant on the 11th floor, which offered great happy hour and fantastic views. It was convenient having those options on-site, as I had driven far to get there, and didn't want to have to get back in the car to find a place to eat. My only complaint is that the hotel is valet-only, which results in unexpected expenses because I felt obligated to tip the valet drivers each time, but that's not a huge deal.	5.0
This place is a dump. The rooms are not clean. The beds are smaller than a normal double bed. The sheets and blankets have cigarette burns in them. The mattress in my room had been torn open with the springs exposed. The rooms all have terrible perfume smell. Only a few channels on the TV work, some don't have sound. The ice machine was full of mold. The overall area that the hotel is in a bad place. When the police are constantly outside in the parking lot it's a sign not to stay there.	1.0
The staff were extremely helpful. They offered directions and even a weather report for us during our stay. The room was very comfortable and well stocked with towels. Breakfast was simple but very satisfying. It is only open for about 2 hours. It has been updated and I really liked the improvements. You can tell that the owners and staffers care about their property and it shines through. I would absolutely stay here again. Very reasonable and a perfect location. Less then a minute from I-95.	5.0

I was only there overnight, stayed on first floor. Room was small but adequate. Wallpaper falling off the wall in bathroom. When AC was turned on there was an awful musty, moldy odor. Had to turn it off due to my allergies. The next morning I found a HUGE spider in the bathtub. I don't do well with these things but managed to somehow drown it in the semi hot water the hotel offered. Have to say that that traumatized me a little. Hate spiders, especially big ones. I managed to take a shower after that, always looking around me for more. After I dressed I decided to make a cup of coffee in the room's keurig, poured the creamer that is supplied into the cup. It immediately curdled! When checking the expiration date on the creamer it read 8/11/15 and my stay was on 9/5/15. After that I just packed up and checked out. Receptionist at desk was nice but didn't offer discount for the problems I encountered. Only good thing I can say is the pillows were comfy. Checking this dump off my list.	2.0

We stayed at this hotel on a Saturday night. The highway is quite close and is quite noisy. Upon entering the room it was clean and smelled good. Our neighbors however were very noisy and rowdy at 1 am and I had not been able to sleep because of all the noise,so I picked up the in room phone and called the front desk......6 times!! No answer. I then used my cell phone to call the front desk directly and they immediately picked up! I was quite upset at this point. They said they would send security to check on the noisy room. Security eventually showed up, and knocked on the wrong room! Needless to say I had to call back and finally persuaded them to switch me to a different room. So at around 2 am, there we are getting all of our stuff packed up again to switch rooms, as soon as we enter the next room, I walk up to the window and find a drone right in front of it peering in! NEVER RETURNING to this hotel, slept maybe 2 hours the whole night	3.0

The hotel is fully functional. I like the fact there are no hallways, as you enter the rooms from the outside. Parking is plentiful. The pool wasn't filled and that was a bummer. The lady at the desk upon check in was pretty snippy. The gal working the desk the next morning was awesome. The restaurant, Bailey's, was worth the stay alone. The food was amazing. The room wasn't perfect. But there were plenty of channels to watch, and the soft water was nice. The bed was big and comfy. There were a couple parts of the room that weren't the cleanest and the exhaust fan in the bathroom didn't work. All in all I stand behind this place being a good choice if you're looking to stay in Norfolk. Don't give the Hampton all your money. Stay here instead.	5.0

I have to first say, I have been staying in just about every Hyatt in the U.S. But the staff at the Hyatt house is hands down the Best !!! I came in for business training. And on the 2nd day my car broke down, after the stress with AAA. Mind you, the hotel staff picked me up, even gave me a ride to pick up my car!! Look I have seen far and beyond going out of the way...but they gave me a peace of mind. And even took the price off the parking!! I mean they didn't have to, it was not their problem. But took the time to help a guest out... On top of that, you can't beat a better view to sleep with than a view of the space needle. Just want to say this is a great place a home from home why I keep coming back !!! Great job gals/guys and thank you!

I stayed here one night because downtown hotels don't shuttle to the airport. I was surprised to find a new, clean, modern hotel. Nothing fancy, but there was a bar. I didn't use any amenities but I thought it was a bargain with a free shuttle and right next to the airport.	4.0
The Ramada hotel is located in Kingman, in Arizona. I might be wrong, but Kingman does not have much to offer to tourist. The Ramada thou is a perfect location for those who are travelling and would like to spend a couple of days relaxing before starting another long trip across the desert.	4.0
Stayed 3 nights for a conference. The rooms are small as this is a historic property, but very nicely decorated, clean and comfortable. There are dimmers on the lamps, robes and nice sheets. Outlets on side of bedside table. Lovely roof Pool and bar. Service was fabulous from fast check in to housekeeping to wake up calls.	5.0
Our stay was perfect. The room was immaculate and location was great.The people at the front desk were so accommodating and helpful.We arrived early and they got us a room before check in time.They gave helpful restaurant choices as well!!Hey Dianne! We are happy you enjoyed your stay! Please come back and see us again! Cheers!	5.0
Now has new owners and managers and it is getting BETTER! Have stayed here a few years in a row, it is a nice little place accross from the beach and close to everything! It needs a little TLC, but I think the new manager will get things done! can't wait to come back next year!!	4.0
Bad: The appetizers 5-7pm were the same for 4 nights in a row. Please provide some variation. Good: Breakfast buffet on the 20th floor was wonderful	5.0
Good: The staff is above and beyond friendly, and it's not insincere. Just great personality. Upgraded our room for my gf's birthday, and a complimentary bottle of wine. Nice touch!	5.0
This hotel has a historic, mixed with modern ambiance. It's a few blocks from the Illinois River with restaurants and the Spirit of Peoria riverboat. The staff was so nice and breakfast was wonderful. The bar had great entertainment too......,....................	5.0
Other than being told on hotels.com that breakfast was included in our cost, but it wasn't, the stay was wonderful. We will be back. For being so close to the airport, no plane noise!!!!	5.0
I was there for a week and my stay was very comfortable. The sheets are very soft and clean, the pillows were really plushie and the room was very clean. As a woman traveling alone, I felt safe inside the Hotel. The continental breakfast was very good but could have offered fruit.	4.0
Simple hotel, good stay. Easy access to gas station, food and dessert places. Rooms are nice, no huge complaints, had a small issue with hot water/shower but the hotel addressed and solved the issue quickly.	4.0
Good: Great location....the room was very comfortable and clean. Nice breakfast and staff were helpful with directions to Chicago sites.	5.0
I understand that this is an older hotel, but I would hope with the Days Inn name, it would be kept up better. The rooms are in drastic need of updating. The room was not as clean as one would expect, and the elevator was dirty. As far as the free breakfast....disappointing doesn't begin to express it. One guest advised one of the staff members that the hot food was not being kept at the required temperature (in fact, it was cold) and there was NOTHING done. The milk for the cereal was left in a pitcher on the counter to get warm. The staff that we encountered was pleasant, but it was not enough for my husband and I to stay there again.	2.0
Good: Location. Peace and quiet. Breakfast good, nice bar.	4.0
Bad: The hotel did not have a fresh, clean smell and the appearance was not appealing.	2.0
i made a reservation for July 11,2015 and when i arrived to check in they had already given my room to somebody else and said they had no reservation in my name . Bashi Patel your business is a joke and you have been reported to hotels.com and the BBB and i am not through yet!	1.0

This is the sixth time we've stayed here. Great rooms, excellent service, and a sweet breakfast with a make omelettes to order chef! Close to USAFA and lots of good stuff. Colleen is the bomb, and will give you wonderful personal service!	5.0
The room was clean. The staff was kind. There was a complimentary hot breakfast that included waffles and scrambled eggs, coffee and yogurt. The hotel is located next to a shopping mall and is not far from restaurants. My daughter enjoyed swimming in the pool. I would stay here again.	5.0
We stayed here for 3 days this past weekend. This is a jewel for Rockland maine, a must stay for the art lover and inspiration for the artist when visiting the area. An enormous amount of thought was put into the design of this property. Beautiful prints are located throughout the hotel. Each floor has a common area that is... More	5.0
Nicely situated in downtown Silver Spring within walking distance of the revitalized shopping/restaurant district. We seemed locked in to the Valet Parking which was not terrible at 15 for a weekend day. Our 6th-floor ice maker was not working so we had to get ice from one of the other floors...not a big deal, either.	5.0
We do a lot of business traveling and have stayed in hotels with kitchenettes that have nothing to cook with and frankly, we don't travel with pots and pans!

Beautiful casino and restaurant and shopping district. Vegas always seems to offer a 5 star experience for much less than other cities. I love this hotel and will be back many times in the future. The staff is friendly, the food is t too pricy and the location is perfect.	5.0
This place is the worst ever!! First of all, we had to pay for our entire stay up front (before we saw the room). Then when we got to the room, it reeked of cigarettes and had cigarette burns on everything. There were roaches coming in under the door and smashed bugs on the wall! There was no hot water...

I picked this hotel due to the airport shuttle mostly. The hotel had exterior renovations underway that impacted parking but not the stay. Friendly staff at check in. Then I noticed the nice outdoor pool. Later (after dark) the pool was packed. Lots of people enjoying the area. Very lively. My room was typical Holiday Inn. Upgraded nicely. Just barely... More	4.0
The staff, room, experience in Chicago for being the first time was great. I would do this again in a heart beat with my family or friends. research your plans before anything you do. Thanks for the help trip advisor also other websites.	5.0
Bad: Toothpaste. I wish more hotels came with toothpaste in the bathroom . I hate calling to get some. It's a necessity. That's my only complaint, but that's pretty much for every hotel I've stayed in. Good: The bed was beyond comfortable, didn't want to get up at all	5.0
As a local, I am loyal to your hotel. I love everything about it! I recommend that my friends from the mainland stay with you. You are awesome!

We stayed here on our way East. The room included a a balcony and a Jacuzzi. The bed was super comfortable. The food and room service were exceptional. Hotel staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.	5.0
Very nice facility. Very good breakfast. Room comfortable. Several non-smoking rooms had stale tobacco smell. The location was a bit distance from Farmington and facilities such as the Pinon Hills Golf course.	4.0
On Monday while watching a news program, the light went off. I waited 10mins nothing happened and I called the front desk and I was told something like: light went out in the entire New Carrollton area. That was not their fault but not to have adequate preparation and provision in case of such occurrence is unacceptable. I was unaware when the back up power came up because my room never had light until the New Carrollton light came back. Business should be business. I paid for a full service, not spending some moment in darkness. Thank you.	3.0
I probably shouldn't brag too much, l don't want the secret to get out what a awesome place this is to stay. Billy, the manager is so nice to deal with, we stay at least every two months and all I do is called the hotel direct and he makes my reservation. Sam is another clerk who's always ready to...

The location of this hotel is perfect. It's literally steps away from the aquarium, World of Coke and Centennial Park.

My trips to Greenville (2 to 3 times a year) are usually at least a week long and I would not choose to stay anywhere else, although I've had to because getting a room at certain times of the year is difficult.

Stayed here for about four days while in town visiting family. We had a two year old with us, and the check in staff offered him a snack from the gift shop upon check in.

Our flight got in late so we needed a place to stay. They sent a shuttle to pick us up at 12:30 AM. They gave us a double bed for my little one and had breakfast in the morning. It's clean with good staff. Plenty of parking. We also got a late checkout.	3.0
Very impressed with the customer service at this Hampton Inn - Patrick, the manager, was incredibly helpful in coordinating my travel through Chapel Hill. The receptionist, Sean, was incredibly kind and welcoming especially after a long day of travel. The room was in great condition and very clean. Hot breakfast and free wifi were great bonuses. Would book here again... More	5.0
The hotel did not have to room I reserved. So I was bribed with free breakfast and free parking. Although it was a nice jester it still doesn't make up for me being placed in a room that did not accommodate my party. I booked 30 days in advance yet these people saw it fit to check other people into those rooms knowing that they had other guests arriving that booked the same room. A guest behind me was told the same thing. The staff was incredibly nice and graceful buy, I guess you have to when greedy corporations overbook hotels and leave them to deal with the customers.	5.0
I stayed at the Wingate in Erie, PA this past weekend. Everything was great, the staff was friendly, the hotel was clean, beds and pillows were comfy, breakfast was yummy. I would highly recommend this hotel.	5.0

we got the jacuzzi suite, room was nice and clean. Pictures of the room look bigger online, but i like the fact the window opens and the beds are comfortable. Location is good, next to steak house Starbucks plus right off 15 Fwy. Customer service was great as well. Will come back :)	4.0
The access to the property was not very well marked so it was very easy to miss the turn into it upon first arrival. The window to the room would not open as it appeared to be half of a sliding window. The wood around the window was OSB that was just painted. The door was very warped and drafty... More	2.0

This Microtel is immaculately clean, everything is sparkling and the service is topnotch and responsive. The beds are very comfortable and the bathrooms are up to date and immaculate.

We love this place! They tried their best to make you feel at home! Even a free bottle of wine for our celebrations! It's so convenient to shopping malls and Waikiki beach!

Bad: This is one of the worst hotels I have stayed in my career. Out of hotel stays in 29 countries, hotel W made the top of the list in poor customer relations, poor cleanliness, and horrible problem resolution. First they gave me an occupied room, then they down graded me to a lower grade room over night. The next day they didn't even clean our room when we returned, and they gave away the original room they were hold for me. The suites bathroom smelled like urine so bad and when we complained, it still was not cleaned by that evening. I had to fight with the hotel to apply a discount rate they never even offered. They have a slogan what ever when ever I can't say they once lived by that motto. This is not my first time at the W hotel organization but it certainly will be my last! Deplorable customer experience and engagement.	2.0
I made reservations online through the Wyndham rewards website and when I got to the hotel the desk clerk informed me that he would have given me a better rate but since I booked online he couldn't change anything. The hallways of the hotel reeked of cigarette smoke. There was a loud argument going on down the hall from our... More	2.0
The hotel was beautiful inside now can't wait to go back again this summer. The atrium balcony is a must.	5.0
We attended a swim conference at the University for three days. This our first visit to the Dunkirk, Fredonia area. We enjoyed the stay and the closeness of the motel to our destination. The area around the campus is beautiful. We found great places to eat.	3.0
Bad: We felt that the hotel was overpriced for the amount we paid. Neither my wife nor I felt that it was worth 265 a night. We make it a point to stay at Hilton properties whenever possible, and this was our first visit to a Hilton Garden Inn it will probably be our last. While the property was nice, it was not what I expected for the price. We get a better value from Hampton Inns. Good: Our room was well appointed and comfortable. As I have come to expect from Hilton properties overall, the hotel was nice.	4.0
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Best Western Twin Islands. The room was comfortable and at a great location within Gatlinburg. I would have enjoyed more breakfast options like bagels or made already made oatmeal with additional add-ins.	4.0
Stayed two nights here while attending a sporting event at Centurylink Center. The hotel is an easy drive from downtown, and just a mile from Westroads Mall with shopping and restaurants.

Friendly and helpful staff at check in. Offered on the go breakfast since we were leaving before breakfast opened. Perfect location if attending the Linn County Expo Center. Great value compared to other local hotels.	5.0
The bathtub had scratches on it that shows black rust. The breakfast ends too early (9:00 a.m.), so if you are coming from a wedding party at 2:30 a.m. you can't sleep enough because you have to rush to have b-fast, and if you have kids you are for sure to miss it! Yet, rooms are spacious, TV is new, internet connection is good, and so is the location. Except from B-fast time and tub condition, I liked it.	4.0
My overall experience at Hampton Inn in Dodge City, ks was excellent. The staff is very professional and courteous. The accommodations were excellent. The atmosphere is pleasant for all ages. The room was spacious and great for relaxing. Breakfast was delicious.	5.0

We couldn't have made a better choice. The Westin was the full package and provided more than we could have hoped for. Many thanks goes to Sarah Locke for doing such an amazing job with the planning and time that went into our wedding reception. We highly recommend!	5.0
Room was quiet. Pool and hot tub available, which was a nice perk.	4.0
Bad: The air conditioner was horrible. The sound of the unit running made it impossible to hear TV. We woke up each time during the night. I commented about it to the desk in the morning.

One room key didn't work, carpets in hallway and at door filthy dirty, as for carpets in room, due to color, not able to see as much, but, come on, if outside door is visibly stained and dirty, what's expected inside.

Wonderful suite hotel in Flagstaff. Convenient, although not in town. This I see as a positive. Everything was clean and efficiently run. Room was simple but very adequate for our needs which were just two nights and would be fine for long-term stays, as well. Really, we were delighted with this hotel.	5.0
Clean, comfortable and complimentary breakfast. Staff was very good and no surprises. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.	4.0

You get what you pay for. The rooms were old and beat up. I slept all of 2 hours the whole night as I felt like there were bugs crawling on me in the bed. I couldn't wait to get out of there. Breakfast was....a joke. Spend the extra and stay at a better hotel.	1.0
No problems here. Just an overnight stay before moving down the road. This is very close to I-78. Some road noise, but not bad all things considered. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast was typical for Holiday Inn Express. Wi-Fi speed was a solid 5 up and 5 down.	4.0
Bad: I don't eat Japanese food and the were limited offerings of American food on the room service menu. Good: Clean, convenient, quiet	5.0
Picked this reservation for an extended stay due to taking care of family matters. Everybody was wonderful. Noemi was very nice and handled my check in with no problem and added by membership to my reservation. Breakfast was great with a nice selection. Would definitely recommend	5.0
Stayed here because rooms were blocked for a wedding. When we entered, the casino was very smoky and hot. They definitely need to move the air around better. The restaurant offerings are limited and some of them don't run well. The service in the restaurants was very slow. The room itself was spacious, clean and well priced. We had one day for a pool day, the temperature was 94 degrees. Imagine our disappointment when we found the pool is shaded by the building the entire day! Also, the pool amenities were all closed down. Huge disappointment -- huge! We would not have stayed here if we would have known. I did have a wonderful massage and it was a great value. If you would like to have the massage of your life, go see Elvira! She is awesome.	3.0
Close to all the beautiful beaches. Resort appears outdated from the outside but pretty nice inside the rooms. Tiki bar is the gem of the resort, what a fun time. Would come back for sure. Bath tub was a little gross, shower head was shady but sht happens!	4.0
Overall it wasn't a horrible stay. We wanted a suite since we were travelling with a baby and child. We were also going to disnleyland and wanted to be able to prep our lunches and come back to make dinner. The kitchens had everything you need!. The breakfast provided each morning was impressive. We first booked into a studio which didn't have a functioning bathtub so we very quickly got upgraded to a two bedroom suite which was extremely impressive. Loads of space. The first day our room got cLeaned the cleaners accidentally threw away my sons baby of baby food, formula and all his supplies. They say it was mistaken for garbage. After a mad dash to Target only a few minutes away is able to replace everything. They gave us a discount on our room. Don't know if I'd stay again as it was still a drive to/from disnleyland which was the main purpose of the holiday. It was close to shopping dining and groceries. If your going for baseball the field is across the road. People complained of trains but we were on the first floor facing the tracks and it didn't bother us one bit.Thank you for choosing the TownePlace Suites Anaheim for your stay. We are delighted to hear the kitchen in the guest room supplied everything you needed and found the complimentary morning breakfast impressive. Additionally, we are very truly sorry that your son's supplies were thrown away by accident. This issue will definitely be addressed in order to prevent this from happening again in the future, please accept our apologies. In addition, the hotel does offer an Anaheim Resort Transit (ART) shuttle stop right outside the front of the hotel and travels to Disneyland for a small fee it usually makes stops every hour daily during Disneys operating hours. The ART tickets can be purchased at our front desk daily and they are good for all day, so you can go back and forth as many times as you wish. We apologize if this was not offered to you upon check-in. Again, thank you for your review of the hotel as these reviews assist us in continuously looking at ways to enhance the stays of all our current and future guests.	3.0

When I arrived at my room it was unlocked. There was a strong musty smell. Being so tired I tried to go to sleep. I woke up not being able to breathe. (I don't have allergies) The hotel was full so I was unable to switch rooms. I asked to check out of the hotel. There wasn't a manager on duty so they refused to check me out. I will never stay at a Ramada facility again.	1.0
They were very accommodating. We had a business meeting in Seattle, and we had to travel there with our toddler. The pack-n-play was already set up in the room when we got there. The internet was easy to connect and pain-free. The room was clean. Overall a very good experience.	5.0
The hotel staff was incredibly friendly. They had coffee and tea available in the lobby throughout the day and the night. The included breakfast was different each day and it was quite tasty for a hotel breakfast. I loved the fresh fruit that was in the lobby at all times and the cookies in the evening. Our room was very clean. The only thing I would recommend is that they scrub the hot tub. Although the hotel is not in Newport, it is a straight drive right into the town.	5.0

We stayed here on our way to Memphis It suited our needs and we'd stay again. Obviously you'd be in a car to stay here as no restaurants next door but we found plenty 5 mins away. Was a sunny day so we stopped by the pool. Small but suited us as we were the only ones there.	4.0

This hotel has changed a bit in the lobby since that day in July 1981 when the skywalks collapsed, killing 114 people and injuring others.I was working at The Kansas City Star then and remember that disaster very well. The newspaper won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of the Hyatt and the aftermath.I think it would be appropriate and in good taste for there to be a small plaque in the lobby noting the deaths and injuries of so many people and how building design has changed since.Today, the lobby looks quite safe, and I am sure it is. The Hyatt Regency disaster has gone down as one that has raised building safety to a much higher standard.	5.0
This Inn is perfect location with amenities that give the comfort I desire. The breakfast is good with many choices. Being able to have my dog with us was a real plus! Local eateries are very good and diverse.	5.0
Bad: The hotel is very outdated. Old rooms (we were moved because of an old airco that made a lot of noise), old elevators, tiny beds that should not be sold as double unless you like sleeping on top of each other, mediocre breakfast with very little healthy options (mind you, a 7 extra charge for a cappuccino is outrageous). Very basic pool area. All in all we would give this hotel a good 3 stars. Not more. Good: Location is ok.	3.0
Overall great stay, staf is very nice and helpful! Shuttle bus on time and 24/7 so very convienient. Also the breakfast at 6 and if you need to go before that, they give you a breakfast baggie to go, very thoughtful! Close to the airport and to Jersey Gardens Mall! I would recommend this hotel and come back here for sure.	5.0
This is the second time I have stayed here. The rooms are large and we had two double beds in ours. I did not use the pool but there were people in it all the time. we had to call down for towels and an extra blanket.	5.0
The stay was great. very pleased with the hotel and its accomodations. The pool area and the dual level hot tub...very relaxing. This hotel had everything around it, especially if you have kids to entertain..bowling ally and ice rink in the back, resteraunt next door with very good breakfast and a ice cream shop with a up stairs popular resteraunt within feet from the hotel. Oh, the Lake, just across the street, very, very NICE!!!	5.0

This was a very beautiful hotel. The rooms were small but clean and quaint. The hotel was located within walking distance from the saturday market and other downtown activities. We had desert in the hotel bar and it was delicious.	5.0
Joy! She was there whenever we needed anything and she was so flexible and understanding. She made great suggestions and understood what we needed before we did. That is kind of how the whole hotel worked. Everything was stocked, clean and worked well. You could ask any staff member for something and they made it happen. Breakfast was stocked and the staff members there were quick to clean and help out. I was really blown away by everyone's attitude. No one seemed to be tired of dealing with guests like you see at other hotels. Carlos checked us out and he showed us the same amount of flexibility and the didn't overcharge for things they could have. Also, it's a great location, close to anything you'd need.We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim.

This was the WORST hotel experience I have ever experienced in my 47 years walking the face of this Earth. The hotel room was egregiously small, the beds were sunken in the middle, the pillow cases, linens, bed spreads and blankets were all filthy, the room had the stench of heavy cigarette smoke, the front desk LIED to me about not having any other rooms available and, to top it off, they still charged my credit card for a two-night stay despite me not even staying 15 minutes. I told the front desk that I was not staying and found somewhere else to stay and they told me that I would not give a refund despite the horrible and horrific conditions mentioned above. Lousy customer service. I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone except the police. And, I would only recommend it to the police in order for them to arrest and file charges against hotel staff for theft -- for charging my credit card when I did not even stay at the hotel.	1.0
We stayed 4 nights and for the price it met far behine my expectation. Every thing is there for you right in this hotel. I love this hotel and I will be booking there again on my next trip to Las Vegas. They rooms are big and very clean. This hotel is great for a family trip,so much to see and do.	5.0
We spent five nights at the Aria for our 1st anniversary. This was our second visit to this hotel. Once again they surpassed our expectations!!

We stayed at this location for one night. It's a nice hotel. The rooms are quite spacious. We were in what probably qualifies as a suite.

Bad: The bed platforms! Perhaps if they were painted white they would become part of the bed and maybe missed a little more! They are now the colour of the carpet - beware!. Good: The staff! Very helpful and welcoming and happy! Loved the L'octaine toiletries. Free bikes were a good idea too but it rained during my visit.	4.0
Needed to be close to the airport and not overpay. Hotel was in the right place for the right price. Very clean, friendly staff and lots of shopping and restaurants. Had to leave before breakfast was served so can't review that.	4.0
The Troubadour is a couple blocks outside the Quarter which is ideal for driving in and out while there's parades happening. The studio room we had was spacious and comfortable. Nice big shower his and her vanity. Though it had somewhat unsettling, disturbing artwork on the walls. The rooftop bar has a great view of the city but it's sadly not accessible 24/7 but only from 5 pm till last call. They should change that as I'm sure it would be equally enjoyable during the day. The drinks are extremely overpRiced. You're better off bringing your own drinks. I also would've liked to see a pool and whirlpool there but there wasn't. The restaurant had delicious breakfast and pastries and the servers were friendly and accommodating. A couple cons: The carpets in the room looked like they hadn't been vacuumed in awhile and a couple days they didn't stock enough towels or tissue. Also be careful to not leave valuables out, even food. We left some freshly boxed muffins on the desk that we intended to eat later but found they had been taken when we returned to the room hours later. The elevators kept malfunctioning that even the staff found inconvenient. The acting manager, Toriano, the first shift front desk people were extremely friendly, patient, competent and professional and compensated for any mishaps we experienced. They offered us a great deal for Mardi Gras weekend compared to the other hotels in the area. I would definitely recommend this hotel while visiting the city.Thank you for your comments, they are very important to us. They allow us to celebrate our successes, and also look for opportunities to improve. We will certainly share the details with our management team to make sure housekeeping is doing a more thorough job while cleaning the rooms while also taking care with guest items. We apologize you experienced these deficiencies. We thank you for taking the time to share and we are excited to see you again in the future.WayneGeneral Manager	4.0
We really only needed rooms to sleep in, as we were in the area visiting family friends. 2 rooms were booked online by different parties at different times on same night.

Location wise it's not bad but this hotel is in need of some renovations. On my visit which was on super bowl weekend only one of the elevators was working.

Super close to things but off a main road so it isnt super busy or loud. Close to the beach, shopping center, and everything else you could need! The employees were helpful and cheerful. I couldn't ask for a better weekend trip. If you're staying for a long time, the rooms were spacious, and had full kitchens !	5.0

I felt compelled to write this after reading the other reviews. While this is an older hotel, the place is absolutely wonderful! Rooms were clean, fridge and microwave in room, nice pool area, it has it all! Staff was friendly and most helpful! Lots to do in the area and would definitely stay here again!	5.0

We stayed at the resort Feb 16-19 first visit ever to longboat key or to the resort. Traveled with my 2 teenage daughters and originally had booked a Junior suite for the three of us.

Nice clean hotel. Check in friendly and easy. Rooms very nice, clean and well appointed. Would definitely recommend to friends and family and stay again myself. Easy access from Route 95, so a great place to stay on long trips that you want to break up. Free breakfast really nice with eggs, sausage and cook your own waffles!	4.0
We stayed at this Best Western in mid-March and were pleasantly surprised at how nice it was for not being a high-end hotel.

It was my first time staying with aloft but now it has become my top choices. The location was great and accessible to trolleys and within walking distance to many spots. The room was well decorated with many chargers. Front desk was really helpful and friendly. The only problem is the terrible sound insulation that I could hear my next door clearly. Many leisures in hotel but I was too busy to explore. Definitely coming back for my next stay in Philly.Hi Jane, We are thrilled you're coming back to Philly and of course our hotel!!! The FIVE BUBBLE review is much appreciated!!! Everyone needs to stay powered up. Thanks for noticing how we placed USB ports all over the hotel!! Bedside in two locations, on the desk, under the W XYZ Bar and throughout the lobby areas. We want to be sure your connected and in touch!Can't wait to have you back! Thank you for your business!Evan	5.0
Overall I was quite pleased with the River Hotel. The location alone makes this hotel worth it. Its located right by the Chicago river 1 block from the Magnificent Mile. There is even a Double Decker trolly stop right near the hotel.The rooms were smaller then normal but there werent uncomfortably small. The bathroom was a decent size and the room had everything I could have wanted.Maid staff was fantastic and left extra towels as requested.Bella Bacino restuarant is located within the hotel and we had a fabulous Chicago style deep dish pizza there.My only concern with the hotel was its hard to see when driving down Wacker drive. Its well hidden. If you cross the Magnificent mile you have gone too far. As well when checking in we had reserved 3 rooms and they were showing a record of only 2 rooms. They did work towards figuring things out but it did take some time. Once we were given our rooms we were told we had 3 rooms with a queen size bed and a sleeper chair. Unfortunatly 2 of the rooms didnt have sleeper chairs so we had to go back to the front desk and be relocated again. It was a bit of a pain but nothing terrible. They did have a secured area on the 3rd floor to store luggage after checking out so that we could still tour the city.All in all a great expericen for the price.	4.0
The TV was out of order and only 1 set of wash clothes in the room for 2 occupancies.	3.0

Hotel options in and near to Leesburg are limited so we chose the Hampton Inn Suites.

First time in New Orleans, planned to stay here for 3 nights but ended up staying for 5. Mainly because he owners, Lauren and Daniel are such excellent hosts. Great advice on where to go and what to do, nothing better than a local to give you advice. The hotel was quiet when we were there so Lauren and Daniel sat with us a breakfast and helped us plan our day. Rooms spotlessly clean. All of their suggestions were spot on. Good little pool with sun deck, unusual for a BB. We visited the WW11 museum which is outstanding but allow at least 4 hours for your visit. Burboun St was a disappointment, but go to Frenchman St for great music and food. Try 30/90o bar for music. Highly recommended and within walking distance, is the Lounge (best ribs ever). Another reviewer spoke of the area, we drove down from Houston and arrived about 6pm, we were slightly concerned as the area has some building with a lot of graffiti on them, however they are being developed and the owners said the area has changed a great deal over the last few years, and is becoming one of NO sought after places to live. Its abut a 5/10 minute trip by uber/taxi into the French quarter. Altogether a great place to stay and would highly recommend.	5.0
Bad: Nothing to not like. All good. Good: The location was good as it was close to restaurants and the harbour. It was also very close to Whole Food supermarket so very handy for a family.	4.0
I had a ball really enjoyed myself!	5.0
We stayed at the Best Western Plus during our long weekend trip to Napa. It was perfectly fine for what we needed, a place to sleep after touring wineries! The room was very clean. We were on the second floor by the pool (not sure if all rooms face the pool) and it was good. Only had one instance where a group of loud girls were in the pool area and it was definitely loud in our room, but thankfully it didn't last long. Overall a quiet place. Got vouchers for Denny's next door, easy and fast breakfast before our days. I saw some reviews mentioning traffic due to the location, but it was always an easy in/out for us. Would definitely stay again if in the area, since it's a great place to rest after a busy day!	4.0
I had asked for a handicap room but did not get one. I guess I would rate the hotel as a 3. The road leading to the hotel was very rough....out of control of the hotel. The hotel offered a very small breakfast area....enough for maybe 6 people. Not what was pictured. Limited parking due to the bar and many Christmas parties.	3.0
There was one issue after the other. We noticed immediately upon entering our room that there was no toilet seat. Traveling with 3 females need toilet seat.

I have stayed at several places for both business and pleasure over the last 12 months and this was one of the very top stays. I was VERY surprised that a small town had a place of the stature. I was staying for my Granddaughter's wedding but will be back very soon. It was GREAT.	5.0
My return stay here was as good as the first and still better than the other main hotel in town. Solid customer service with clean, comforatble, and quiet rooms is what I look for while on the road and I found it here again here. The value is also spot on. Despite the ongoing stucco and paint work outside, it... More	4.0
It was Ok, but the conditions of the room needs to be more light and more clean.	3.0
This place is as basic an accommodation as you can get in downtown Atlanta while still being suitable. Yes there is free parking but this place is so cheap that they don't even give you free shampoo in the bathroom - just two little bars of facial soap. Place isn't in the greatest area (downtown Atlanta is kind of sketchy at night) but is centrally located. For a healthy restaurant nearby I recommend Metrofresh - it's less than a ten minute drive and totally worth it! Basic cheap motel quality beds, old TVs, frustrating elevator that takes forever to close and absolutely NO FRILLS. Got it for 53/night using a coupon code on the Motel6 website.	2.0

Stayed 3 Nights. Hotel Ruby of Ponderay has a great appearance. There are many wide parking spots. It is nicely kept with a very open and modern looking lobby that includes a common area TV and dinning facility. The Staff is friendly and kind. Breakfast, though basic was good and satisfying with the bonus of a waffle maker (Which I always like). The room was very clean and the bed was soft and comfortable. Temperature control worked great. The room was not as spacious as other hotels rooms can be, but there is also no wasted space. Wifi worked very well and has several routers depending on what section of the hotel you are in. The pool and sauna were nice too. And did I mention the price. Best deal in town price wise. If I ever return to Ponderay, this Hotel would be my first choice.	5.0
I was quoted a price over the phone of 383 weekly and even used my credit card to hold the room. On the day of check in i arrived and my room wasn't even ready even after 5pm then I was told that room would be over 500 per week and i couldn't afford that. All the man at the... More	1.0

My first impression was that the lobby was full of pimps and hookers! The hotel was very nice, very clean but the guys standing by the door asking if they could bum a cigarette as I checked in with my 3 small sons skeeved me out a little bit. The room was clean, beds comfortable, towels fluffy, we checked in at 11.30pm and were out by 9am so it was a place to sleep and nothing else.	4.0
I can't say enough good things about this hotel. This was our second trip to Chicago, but our first at The River Hotel. The room was small, but the dcor and the view made up for it. The staff was very friendly, not a single person passed us without saying hello and asking us how we were. The concierge desk was fantastic! Tim was amazing, his recommendations were spot on, he helped us with directions, whether it was taking the train, a bus or walking. It was refreshing to have the help when you are travelling. Roman was also very helpful. We will definitely be staying here again.	5.0
Hotel was wonderful. Location, staff, amenities, cleanliness were great. Loved the choice of pools. Two small issues:. Shower needs a grab bar to help older and/or mobility challenged guests in and out. A!so, the discounted rate was clearly reflected in our room location. Less than pleasant view, near hotel HVAC equipment which burped and gurgled 24/7, and door to room 5 steps from ice and vending machines.	4.0
My 93 year old mother and caregiver were evacuated due to the fires. This Best Western made every accommodation to make them welcome and comfortable.

They behaved as compassionately as possible.	5.0

I spent the weekend at the Hampton Inn in Gloucester, Va and the entire experience was perfect! The staff was helpful and friendly, housekeeping did a great job and the breakfast staff was great. I couldn't have asked for a better stay!Thank you for your review of the Hampton Inn in Gloucester. We are delighted that your stay was so pleasant. Looking forward to your return!	5.0
I booked a non smoking and at check in we were told that if there is any smoking in the room it is a $200 charge. As soon as we walked into the room you could smell the smoke from someone prior. I alerted the front desk and was offered to have someone spray the room. what good does that do.	3.0

I travel extensively and normally visit at least three states per month for work. Hilton family hotels are my preference when I travel and I have stayed at a lot of them.

I've stayed at this motel prior but this time was quite disappointing. We checked in at 2pm, rooms still not completely ready.

Very beautiful, quiet and decent priced hotel. A little far from the beach but we enjoyed the pool when we came from the beach.	5.0
The hotel staff are super friendly and helpful. The hot breakfast is also very good. Apart from the usual cold fare, the hot part included scrambled egg, home fries, and one other item (bacon or sausage or biscuit/gravy) during our stay. But that's where the positives end. The hotel condition is pretty bad. Rooms, elevators and all other common areas need major renovation. Many small issues existed in our room to name a few - the faucet head was broken, the hooks in the bathroom were missing, the phone was not working, the in-room lighting was poor (probably the darkest hotel room in my experience and I travel a lot). Oh, I forgot to mention one other positive - the free shuttle van to nearby places including the metro station. All in all, it's a ok hotel if you are a student or in a tight budget. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.	3.0

Location is great for Metro boarding to DC. No one at the front desk at check-in or check-out. Hallways/stairwells do not smell good at all.

The hotel was up to date very clean. The room was roomy comfortable enough for us to entertain family. Breakfast was wonderful! They had made to order omelets, bacon, fruit, etc which is free. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that someone was smoking marijuana on out floor children were running wild! Otherwise a good experience I would stay again!	4.0

Clearly this is a popular hotel. One look at the lobby area, the common areas, and your room will tell you this hotel gets lots and lots of use. It looks like it needs some TLC and a face lift. Nothing is dirty, just shabby. Nothing is worn to a fray, just run down. The staff is friendly and efficient but not especially helpful. The furnishings in the room were probably highly functional when installed but now really show their age and overuse. The sofa in my room was stained in many places. The linens were gray from cleaning too many times, the bed a little lumpy from too many nights use without replacement.Not a bad hotel, just not a great hotel either.Dear GoldenBearHusker,Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Marriott.

Having a full kitchen is a great feature and breakfast included is a nice way to start the day. Our room was close to the office and that worked out well for us. Our only complaint was that the bathroom door, room 202, did not lock. All staff were very friendly anf helpful. A schedule for the shuttle would have helped and notification that there is a senior rate for the shuttle.We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim.

Stayed at the Suncoast for a week in Feb. 2003. A big, impressive building but understand that it is about a good 20 minute drive on expressways to get to the strip. You will be at the extreme northwest section of the Las Vegas area making it time consuming to get to other parts of the city, but from what we saw this is probably the nicest area in greater Las Vegas (shopping, golf courses, restaurants). Good amenities at the Suncoast, the restaurants in the casino were all great and a good value. Bowling center, movie theatre, nice pool/spa area. Our only reservations concerned the (standard) room we had. The bed had unfitted sheets and mattress pad that just slid all over the mattress and bunched up. The first three nights whoever made the bed left the sheets a foot short at the bottom so that our feet were on the mattress pad. The carpeting looked a bit trafficked. Still, our overall experience was good.	3.0

We stayed a Friday to Monday and was a little put off by the Club music coming from the bar attached to the lobby but overall it was a nice stay. I loved how relaxed they were at the pool area so we could enjoy ourselves instead of feeling gawlked at. It must be a state law but I found it odd they had a lifeguard on duty for such a small pool but he was cool and pretty much stayed to himself the whole time. I didn't like the area and it was a hassle to get on the highway. I probably wouldn't stay there again but I didn't have a bad experience.	3.0
Very disappointed...this is a 3 star It is a 40+ year old hotel they are trying to bring up to date. I commend them for trying to make improvements, but the workmanship was very shoddy and unprofessional. The tile in the bathroom was only 1/2 grouted. The shower faucet was hanging by a screw coming out of the wall. Dried paint was all over the bathroom floor where they painted the walls after laying the tile--without covering it--or cleaning up after. Ceiling texture was all over the light fixtures and mirrors. Lighting in hallways was dark and scary.	2.0

The Broome doesnt feel like NYC at allIt captures the elegance of Morocco and you feel a world away from the traffic and bustle of the city. The rooms are small, which is standard in NYC, but I did expect a bit more space for the price. The beds are comfy with super luxury sheets. This might be an odd point, but many of the luxury hotels I have been in lately have moved away from using a fitted sheet on the bed, which leaves the guest with a flat sheet on the bottom that twists and bunches by the morning. I was delighted that The Broome still uses both flat and fitted sheetsit is a must for a good nights sleep! The staff is enthusiastic and welcoming. A good stay, indeed!Dear ECWPhD:On behalf of the team, thank you again for staying with us and thank you for sharing your feedback with us. It was a delight welcoming you into our little Oasis.

We used hotel's free shuttle service to the Metro station daily during our vacation. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was comfortable. We noticed two negatives in the room: the paint in bathroom was pealing badly and the tub did not drain well the first day.

This place is really over the top from a luxury standpoint and overall experience.

The grout in the bathroom was filthy,  the rooms are out dated.  The noise we got being on the 39th floor must have been from poor insulated glass.  We could hear the cars driving.  The bed wall was aginst the two elevators running up and down all night.  The breeze way running to the vehicle garage was being used as the smoking area buy the staff.  It was suffocating coming in and out of the building.  The only time we ate there was first day in the morning.   The buffet was horrible.  The bacon was rock hard,  the powdered eggs tasted like caulk, the ham was nothing but grease.  Very unhappy with the meal.  And to top it off it cost $35.00 for two of us.  I had continental breakfast that had more to offer, and alot better taste. Adding the 34.00 for car parking,  the horrible breakfast,  and two nights of restless sleep.   It cost me 700.00.  This is a very unsatisfied customer that will post to other trends to let people know that this is hotel shouldn't even have a rating.	2.0
We have been here several times, once when the current owners had just purchased it. They went out of their way to make us comfortable then.

I've stayed at this hotel before and was pleased when Hotels.com again offered it at such a reasonable price. The hotel van comes promptly to the airport, check in was speedy and the room was clean and welcoming. The one issue was that I arrived at the hotel tired in the middle of the afternoon and the pool did not open until 6 PM. I get that they mostly get traveling businessmen but having the pool available in the afternoons would be a great advantage to work off some sore muscles and traveling frustration. Hotel itself though is great.	5.0
Rooms are spacious, clean, and staff are excellent. The ONE thing that stood out (unfortunately), was the coffee. I am a coffee drinker. I've had too many brands to count.

We was looking for a hotel that was nice but wasn't expensive and I found just that at the Aloft. I made a reservation and when I got there It went so smooth I was up to my room in less than 5mins and I had a preference to check in at 11:00am and it was granted with no extra charge. The room was very nice and clean and smelled good. The shower I LOVED and the full body mirror I couldn't stay out of. The staff was very nice and friendly.

We arrived very late but glad to find a clean, comfortable room. Pillow tops on bed were an extra gift to my husband who had been driving for 3 days. Building is a little tired, but clean. If you need stores or restaurants, there are MANY good ones nearby.	3.0
Bad: The Parq Bar menu is extremely poor. The hotel charges 6 delivery fees for room service! There is no open buffet option for breakfast. The breakfast area is understaffed, and the 1 or 2 waiters/waitresses there are slow and inefficient. Good: The location of the hotel is amazing. The Parq Bar atmosphere at night is very nice. The concierge service in the hotel is very efficient.	4.0
This is one of my all time favorite hotels. I know it may sound absurd, but one reason I look forward to visiting SF is to stay here! The hotel staff is great, friendly and super competent.

I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. It is in an excellent location - waterfront- right near the downtown Dunedin action. I would recommend staying here. The hotel has a bar and restaurant, waterfront view, great parking, great views	5.0
We travel to Sedona for one week every year and have tried a number of luxury hotels (including L'Auberge). This is now our favorite!! We had a 2 bedroom creekside condo.

Excelente! Fui por 8 dias y 7 noches. Un servicio muy bueno, los desayunos calientes, limpieza del cuarto excelente y todos los dias realizaban limpiezas en los cuartos. Cerca de centros comerciales y frente al hotel la parada del autobus y te lleva hasta el downtown de Baltimore. Y a la estacion del tren. Lo recomiendo, muy buenos precios.	5.0
You get what you pay for. The staff was terrific. The rooms need updating. Carpet was a bit worn. The breakfast was so so. Overall the place was clean and a bargain for the price. We would stay there again if in the area.	4.0

Room 116 was a nice sized room with a couch and a king bed. The only downside was that it was basement level. Our window looked out to the knees of passer-by's which meant that we had to keep the blinds closed or people would look down into our room. Zero privacy. Otherwise the hotel was nice and the staff did a good job. No complaints.	4.0
Nice, clean rooms, safe - ( they had a night guard on every floor ), friendly helpful staff, good service, efficient shuttle to metro station. The surrounding neighborhood was OK, but not an area you'd want to spend time in. The commute to DC via car and metro was not bad, but a bit longer than I would have liked. The hotel was right off the exit.	4.0
Amazing hotel staff! The manager upgraded us to a kid suite so my family of 5 could sleep more comfortably. It wasn't needed but much appreciated after driving 7 hours. Extra towels and overall pleasant!	4.0

Beautiful hotel! Room was perfect, with several bonuses such as press-button controls of the blinds, lights, and TV.

This Hotel was much better than expected after reading some of the negative reviews here. I was incredibly pleased with the room, the staff, and the location. The room was fairly modern with 2 perfect double beds. The bathroom and shower were perfect. The Hotel is a 5 minute drive to downtown Napa and about 10-15 minutes to the Silverado Trail. The hotel provided breakfast coupons to Denny's which is directly next door and was perfect for us - I had a healthy egg-white and fruit breakfast while my travel companions gorged themselves on Denny's Grand Slam. I would definitely return here for its cleanliness, staff, and proximity to everywhere I wanted to be.I am glad we surpassed your expectations. We pride ourselves on our clean well appointed rooms and our customer service. Thanks for the review and we will see you on your next visit.	4.0
The Troubadour is excellent. Clean, secure and accommodating. All are super friendly and helpful. Quiet, felt safe and the extra was coffee, hot and ready, in the lobby each morning. Centrally located.Thank you for the great review, we look forward to your next visit. Wayne General Manager	5.0
This hotel gives you what you would expect from Holiday Inn Express clean comfortable quiet rooms, friendly staff, breakfast good including hot and cold selections, fresh fruit. Nice pool and hot tub	5.0
The rooms were outdated. But they were clean and very comfortable. The hotel has so much potential but it's not being used as it should. I would def stay here again. Price was good. Breakfast was a little disappointing but it worked for what we needed.  The shower was really nice. Endless hot water.  Tv channels we a let down. But we were so sleepy we didn't care.   Will stay here again.	4.0
The desk clerk Jasmine was super nice and the room was comfortable. I would definitely stay there again and while the hotel is a older venue it was clean and offers free shuttle service and continental breakfast which are nice amenities as other venues don't offer these simple accommodations. There is a restaurant on-site which can be accessed within the hotel which is nice as you don't have to go outside (it rained for a couple hours - LOL). I would recommend a modification to the menu to offer more selections. I had the calamari which was okay (I've had better and the potato skins (I've had better) but they both satisfied my hunger so all good on that end. Upon check-out final bill was ready and shuttle was on time. i did forget to tip the driver which I didn't think about initially as i was focused on getting my bags checked in so this CA lady do apologize for that.	5.0
I loved this little motel. At first we picked it just for the location and price. Turned out to have very friendly service, and clean rooms.

Pleasantly surprised. Decently priced, clean, and super friendly staff. The discovery of a pool right outside of our widow the next morning, was an added benefit. We would definitely stay here again. The only drawback would be the weak Wi-Fi. I mentioned it to the front desk on check out and they seemed surprised even though many comments state the same thing.	5.0

The hotel has seen better days. The room was adequate and clean, but nothing to rave about. The indoor pool was very cold despite being heated. My son and I could only stay in for about 20 minutes. We were on the 6th floor and it had a peculiar smell in the hallways that suggested they might be renovating on that floor...it was that chemical smell...of new carpet or glue...not sure. Our room service dishes stayed in the hallway one full day and night after we finished with them.... Overall...probably won't go back, it was just so-so	3.0

I stayed here mid May for a large planned Birthday Party. I arrived at 2:00 pm for a room which I had pre-paid for and they were out of rooms so they can me an upgrade to a 10th Floor Penthouse suite at no extra cost, it was amazing and very large.I had come a few years later for a weekend function but stayed next door at the Marriott. Suncoast is almost as nice but far cheaper.Sunday Brunch was OK but a good deal for 19.00 ( you get a discount at all restaurants if you get their free membership card). I didn't try other restaurants. They are building a lot of Shops and restaurants across the street.I like the area as well, quiet and close to Red Rock Canyon.	4.0

Great hotel for price. Large rooms with good views. We had small toddler and he had room to play and climb--very spacious! Room was very clean and hotel staff was great. Nice breakfast (eggs, waffles, French toast, fruit, yogurt). Everything was great, but the pool. Pool was extremely small and was greenish in color. I was surprised at how small it was. Other than that, great hotel for the money and it is close to the inner harbor and National Aquarium. Don't valet, as they charge 42 per day. Garage behind hotel was 3 on the weekend and we parked there 20+ hours. During week it was only 14 to park overnight.	4.0
The staff was great especially the valet. The room had no sound proof. Drunk people in the hall at midnight and we heard everything. We were on the 7th floor and everytime someone ran over a manhole cover we heard the noise clear as day. The worst was the tub though. You can tell they had a bath fitter installed but there was water between the old tub and the new liner so it felt as if we were showering on a water bed. Who knows what was growing in between the two surfaces. Also our one pillow had a big brown stain on it.	2.0
The room was spacious. The bed, however was hard and uncomfortable as well as the air conditioner being very noisy. The breakfast was almost nonexistant. It was nice to have a service that took you back and forth to the airport.	3.0
A little pricey, however the location and service was excellent. Breakfast is not the best, at least as a Diamond level is complementary. I highly recommend this property, location, staff and rooms are excellent. Thank you for taking the time to write this review of your stay and we are delighted to know you enjoyed almost everything about your stay. We are currently transitioning our restaurant and trying out some new items and processes, please know that the breakfast service will improve as this is a main priority. It was our pleasure to have you as our guest and do hope to have you stay with us again.Best regards	5.0

Comfortable and clean rooms with a friendly staff. The hotel was very quiet - I heard very little noise from other guests. The amenities included complimentary bottled water near the elevators and snacks in the 2nd floor business center. The hotel's location is excellent and right on the river.

We look forward to having you back with us next time you come to Chicago!	5.0
Everything from the property to staff were delightful. This place lacks a pool however. They pride themselves on authenticity. I requested a late check-out and was surprised to have that shut-down immediately. They did however accommodate an early check-in from 4:00 to 1:30ish.	5.0

Third time visiting this hotel!! Great stay will come again!! Real close to Riverbanks zoo!!	5.0
We stayed here because we needed a room that would sleep 6 people at a decent price. Upon arrival, the front desk staff were friendly...even though they tried to charge my card twice. They were always willing to help whenever the need arose though. The housekeeping staff were quite the contrary. If you needed anything outside the ordinary, they seemed bothered or afraid they were going to get in trouble from management. The room was dated but was comfortable. All ammenities worked as advertised and the room was similar to the pictures. The restaurant (Tradewinds) provided above average food at an affordable price. The pool was large enough for a large number of people but wasn't cleaned during our stay. (4 Days) It was open 24 hours though, which was nice as we arrived late the first night and did activities during the day/evening. Being off of the boardwalk provided a quiet experience which was nice. Also, there is a Food Lion directly across the street which we used to stock our cabinets and refrigerator. The beach was clean and also had a lit volleyball court after dark. My overall experience is as title states.	4.0

We stayed at the Aloft for a business trip. It was super convenient having this hotel right next door to convention center! Staff nice, rooms clean, beds were comfy and spacious, great bar and outdoor space to relax! Ill stay here again if I have to come back for work. Train station a little over two miles away. I submitted a survey the first night there asking for an orange pen (they have the best) and the next day before lunch there was a bag hanging on my door with four pens in it. Talk about paying attention to detail. What a great customer experience. Hi Sarah, FIVE BUBBLES!!! We love it, thank you!! Glad you got some time to chill in our Backyard, it's the perfect place to hang after a day of work. If the 4 pens run out, you know where to get more :) Come back just for fun, we are not only about serving you for work. Perhaps you can PEN a best seller...Happy Summer, Evan	5.0
Stayed for Baseball Spring Training @ 140 CAD., the free WIFI is a total Joke, no reception at all in the room and very limited in lobby and kept logging off, we have 4 devices so I know it was not the device. I asked if I can pay for wifi to get better reception, was told that's all they offer.The pool has problems as it's leaking all over the place outside, twice there and no towels, when asked for towel, they only brought 2 towels. If you don't get the room service by 10 am, they won't come back.Room was clean but little small for 4 people.	3.0

We chose this hotel because it accepted our pets. We were on the second floor, and there were no elevators, but that was just a minor inconvenience.

I stay here frequently. It is right across the highway from where I deliver trucks. The rooms are always clean and comfortable and the owners are friendly and helpful.

We spent 3 nights at the Four Points. It was well worth the money. Very convenient to the metro which we took the 2 full days that we went into Washington D.C. The hotel will take you and pick you up from the metro with their shuttle. The neighborhood is not the greatest, but I felt safe. There are several surrounding business like an Ihop, pizza place, and 7-11. A New Carrollton officer sat in the 7-11 parking lot 2 of the nights we were there. I would definitely recommended Four Points.	4.0
My son and I recently spent two nights at this hotel and really enjoyed it.

I am currently in house and felt in necessary to write a review immediately. This hotel is amazing and I would recommend it to any and everyone staying in NOLA. The entire staff is fantastic and friendly. Even prior to arrival, their service was seamless. I had to send a credit card authorization because my wallet was stolen and it was handled by the staff in no time at all. I even mentioned that I was arriving super early in the morning and I arrived at 9am to find my room was already checked in and waiting for me, which was so beyond my request. It is hip, trendy, fun, lively and worth every dollar. The room, while on a low floor, is perfect. I had a problem with my television, which I normally need to sleep and even though it was late and the staff could not immediately rectify the issue, it was the way it was handled that truly made all the difference. I could not be more pleased. I will say one thing.. a word to the wise, if you will. Bourbon Street will get you every time. I was somehow hungover by 6pm. Drink Responsibly.	5.0

Quiet neighborhood. Less than 10 miles to Sea World, Old Town, and Seaport Village. Double bed rooms do NOT have a sofa sleeper, as indicated when I booked (should be changed by now). We've stayed at several hotels in this chain, and we've always had a sofa sleeper and, usually, queen beds. Hotel staff was very accommodating, though, when I discovered this and they came up with a satisfactory solution. Breakfast is good, although very crowded.	4.0

This best western is the next best thing to the casino maybe even equal comfort that's close to the boardwalk. I have been staying at this location for years. I even have a favorite room. They since have remodeled and it's really nice modern decor. It's generally inexpensive, but can sometimes be the same rate as the casinos because of its popularity. I always enjoy my stay and it's close to everything. One block from the boardwalk. There is a seven eleven across the street that has everything. There is a rite aid, liquor store, restaurants and laundromat few steps away. Highly recommend this location and nice staff in the lobby.	4.0

We stay at this hotel several times during the year while visiting family. Always have a peaceful and comfortable sleep. The bed is very comfortable and the breakfast items are a nice touch for a quick grab and go if you don't have time to go to the restaurant next door.

Facility was in good shape and clean. A little awkward to get to. NO ELEVATOR! The room was spacious. Having said that some of that space should have been invested in the bathroom.

The room was clean and quiet even with the freeway right across the street. Breakfast was OK but nothing to write home about. It has an indoor heated pool but it must of been heated by the moon because we didn't feel the heat only from the jacuzzi. Other than a cool pool we had a great trip.	3.0
We booked in here due to an early morning flight. It was a little more expensive than what we usually pay for when staying at a hotel but it was definitely worth it. Very lovely clean room, and the staff were very helpful and polite. The only downside was (upon checking out) the early morning shuttle driver was running a little late, and due to the amount of people and luggage, was stressed and became rude when trying to squeeze the last few people on the shuttle......however the shuttle driver the day before was very friendly and helpful so it all evened itself out.	5.0
This is the 2nd of many business trips to PB. Great hotel in quite location. Close to several good eating spots. Nice clean room and bathrooms are big. Hot breakfast is great way to start the day. Staff is always friendly, even when outside smoking.	5.0
Bad: The website for hotel says happy hour food and a drink included. Nowhere on booking.com or Kinzie website does it mention that it's not included. So we were charged for it. I requested to have it removed and haven't heard back if they did so. But besides that, where the drinks/food is located is in a room with no windows/a dark cave. Not nice and not worth going to it. Sorry, nice thought but did not like. In this world of communication, it should be noted that there is a charge. Good: It was clean. Had good hair products. Bed and pillows were comfortable.	3.0

We made reservations well over a month prior. However, after a long drive a two tired kids we were informed at check in that they were out of double beds. I get they made a lot of $ from a large group but we paid too! Could not care less either. Lier would be one word to describe this service	2.0
Bad: At breakfast the waiter gave you a receipt stating that although the breakfast was free (included in the price of B B) it was worth 49.98, ie they were after a tip. I felt this was unnecessary and made guests feel uncomfortable. The breakfast was self service, the waiters just brought tea and coffee.

Would be happy to give 6 stars if I could. Outstanding in every way. Service is the stand out. Everyone was exceptional. The room was very nice and the bed was the coziest ever. Food was great!

it was the last night of a 12 day, 12 state motorcycle vacation. Really just looking for a clean place after a long, long day. The place was musty smelling when we walked in, the sheets looked as if they had been washed, but still had a dirty quality, the bathtub needed a good scouring, just in total, not clean... More	2.0
Bad: I will write in English so the staff can read if they wish: we arrived exactly at 4 PM (declared check in time), the room was not ready, the reason being 20 people having done an early check in, please notice that check out time is 11 AM (so they clearly have a workforce planning problem)! An extremely unfriendly staff representative told us that we had to wait, asked me to give her my phone number so that I can receive a text message when the room would be ready, meanwhile we were granted a pass for the pool (which was no extra given that the pool was available for all hotel guests as we were). I asked according to your experience, how long will it take 20 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours her answer was rude and dismissive I don't know, the only thing I can tell you is to wait for the text message. At that time your room will be available!. So we went to the pool (definitely small and overcrowded), no seats available, very noisy. We waited, and waited and waited and waited... 2 hours and 20 minutes, then I went back to the lobby extremely upset, I started complaining and magically the room was ready... By the way: the text message never arrived. Good: Free parking (is this something to be appreciated)	3.0
WE stayed at the Washington DC site and the staff was not accomidating to people who had never been in the DC area before. We asked for direction and way of getting around and they were very disinterested in helping us (there were 9 of us). When we went down to the continental breakfast we were asked where our coupon for brekfast was we asked if our room key would do she said no. We went down to the front desk got the coupon went back up and she said okay you have it but NEVER even looked at it we could have shown her a fake card she would have never have known she jsut made it inconfience for us to eat. Beware that if they say you can walk somewhere that it will only take you 20 minutes plann for 45 to hour they have no sense of time or distance.	3.0

Great place to stay. Our daughters softball team participated in the OKC challenge we attended the women's college World Series. Hotel was not centrally located but we didn't mind driving around. Hotel was clean, AC worked well beds were soft. Very good quality for what we paid.	5.0
For the location and price this place is a diamond in the rough. It was clean, had all the amenites one would like. But do not expect any service from the staff. The hispancis who cleaned up were the most friendly, they did speak each morning. There was a buffet breakfast that was offered (for a price), we were not even told about it. My daughter found it while exploring the hotel. They run two shuttles to the metro station, neither one would detour out of their way to drop us off at Arlington National Cememtary for a funeral. As I said before the property is well keep, clean, nice and for the location and price a deal. But do not expect southern hosptality or anyone to go out of their way to do anything special for you.	4.0

We stay here all the time when visiting family in the area. This is my favorite Hampton Inn. Great rooms, super staff, great breakfast, good location close to shops, mountains and beach.

The room was ok. It took 10 minutes for me to check in with no wait. The young lady at desk was apparently occupied in back office. Had to call front desk just so she would come up front. Noticed in my room there was a rag hanging on the shower that had been used and the trash can had trash in it. Went to complain and of course no one was at front desk. Didn't stay the night. Lesson learned	4.0
We had a wonderful stay at the Suncoast our hotel room was facing the pool and the views were absolutely perfect. It's very nice to visit Las Vegas and kind of get out of the rat race of downtown. Nice location about 20 minutes from the strip. Hotel was very clean plenty of stuff for the kids to do also the arcade was inexpensive and the gentleman that work there was very helpful. The pool area was beautiful and they also have bowling with tons of lanes and a movie theater which neither did we get to explore. We were there to visit family and kind of busy running around. I would Highly recommend this hotel to people visiting with kids to Las Vegas. Pictures are Views from our room 455. The only reason I did not give it an excellent is because you have to walk through the casino to get to the hotel room and you feel like you smoke a few cigarettes by the end of the Walk. I'm not a cigarette smoker	4.0

Bad: the hotel was just ok the employees were friendly and helpful but the area is a little rough, had to walk 4 or 5 blocks before you found anything going on other than other hotels. The area outside of the hotel is dirty up and down the streets.	4.0
This appeared to be a brand new hotel. It is extremely clean, bright and modern. They have a guest laundry on the 3rd floor that you can do yourelf. It costs 1.50 to wash and also to dry. The only complaint I had about that was there was no change machine in the laundry room, so I had to make a trip downstairs for that. They have a computer off the lobby where you can easily get on the internet for free. That was great to check emails, print out maps, etc. The breakfast there is included but ends at 9 a.m., which for vacationing families seemed very early. The breakfast was OK, but the same every day. The lobby is great, (you actually eat breakfast in the lobby area.) The workout room was very nice. It was large and actually had free weights, not just the usual treadmill. My son and I swam in the indoor pool one night and were the only ones in it. When you first walk in the pool area, it feels like a sauna, but is very nice to feel when you get out soaking wet. The location is right off 264, and it took us only about 10 minutes to get downtown and the same to get to the beach. There are really no restaurants real close by except for Ruby Tuesdays which is basically in the parking lot. You can walk there. The rooms are huge, plenty of room for a family to spread out. The furnishings are very pretty (artwork, lamps, curtains). They have music playing in the hallways near the elevators (which are very large as well.) Overall, this place was great.	5.0
Great location, super friendly well groomed professional staff, clean facility. Hands down the best hotel in town. Prices at the restaurant are reasonable. They have amazing food too. They have a really nice pool for the kids that is always clean. My kids love staying here.	5.0
My wife and I stayed here for three nights in April, coming from Victoria on the Clipper. The hotel was very conveniently located, just four blocks from the ferry terminal. We were met by Lee, who was very courteous, and very helpful with suggestions and directions for sightseeing and restaurants. The room was very nice, and very quiet. We enjoyed happy hour in the lobby, and we had one dinner in the restaurant downstairs. The ambience is very retro. The front-desk and cleaning staff were wonderful. We could do all of the sightseeing we wanted on foot. Chihuly Garden and Glass was a highlight. Highly recommended.Dear Guest,Thank you for this fantastic review! Our location really is ideal for 'on-foot' sightseeing of the Chihuly Museum/Space Needle as well the Pike Place Market. Nice when we are perfectly placed in the middle of these two iconic spots! Your kudos for Lee are so appreciated as well. We pride ourselves on making guests feel as if they've traveled to a home away from home, so it would be our greatest honor to welcome you back as our guests again in the future. Please feel free to reach out to me directly when you consider your next trip to Seattle :)Best Regards,David Bayley	5.0

This well kept secret has excellent and friendly service with reasonably priced rooms. The absence of a restaurant and bar in the hotel is barely noticed as numerous restaurants and bars are only steps from your room. I would put this hotel up against any on the beach with service and cleanliness. The hotel is updating all the rooms, which are slightly dated, to reflect an Asian influence. This includes projection TV and steam shower. I can't wait!	5.0

For the rate of 200, it would've at least been nice to get a complimentary bottle of water with the room. There's a hampton inn down the road that is just as 'nice', would rate as average, and provides a breakfast with the rate. I guess if you're getting reimbursed for expenses, then your rating would be higher.I am sorry to hear your stay with us did not quite meet your expectations.

I stayed at the hotel while attending the Harvard LEV program. The room was luxurious, spacious and had all the comforts needed for this busy week. Wifi was a little inconsistent, but not too challenging. I would definitely stay again the next time I'm in Cambridge.	5.0
When I first walked into the hotel(at approximately 15 minutes after check-in) there were about 3 or 4 employees sitting at tables and chairs at the entrance. (This was the common area where the continental breakfast is served). Upon check in I was told there were no rooms available. The employees had not finished cleaning the rooms. I am from NJ and was in VA for the weekend. The front desk clerk asked me if I had anywhere else to go while they had the opportunity to finish cleaning the room. The check in time stated on my reservation was 3:00 p.m. Apparently, the hotel did not receive this message. Eventually, I was able to receive a room. However, I definitely will never stay at this hotel again due to the bad service received at check in and for the attitudes of some of the employees.	2.0
Stayed in a King room with a pullout sofa for teen daughter. Shower pressure was great and room had a fridge. Had a lovely view of the lake and enjoyed watching the Kenmore float planes take off and land. The staff is excellent at this location. The bartender made some excellent recommendations for dinner. Ask for a coffee cup at the desk as they have complimentary Starbucks in the little market. Prices are expensive for a Courtyard but Seattle is an expensive town.Hello handwesh,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay at the Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union hotel.

Should your travels bring you back to Seattle, we hope to have another opportunity to serve you. Sincerely,Dan PhamGuest Service Representative	4.0
I'm glad that we went through Expedia for a lower rate. I would have been very upset if we had paid full price. One of the elevators did not work. The air did not work in the whole building. Only the air units within the rooms worked. The place was very stuffy and seemed unorganized at times. All in all - since we were there for a Lax tournament it was decent. But, I would not go there for a get-a -way.	3.0

Nice hotel with an excellent location. Large, modern rooms. Nice facilities and great internet connection. I remove one star because housekeeping service is on request only during the weekends.

Called Labor Day 2015 (we stayed part of the weekend) to locate a couple lost bathing suits and Scott called me back Tuesday, located the suits, dried them out before sending them to me. He made several calls in that time frame to verify the items and really went the extra mile. Thank you!	5.0
Rudeness at front desk. When we checked in the front desk person was unfriendly and short of patience with my hard of hearing issue.

The place is a dump. Room was filthy and looks like it wasn't cleaned. I stood at the front desk for 5 minutes before she even acknowledged me. The room was musty and was almost afraid to lie down on the sheets because of bedbugs. Stay anywhere else but here. This place should be condemned.	1.0

When we booked there was nothing to say about a dance club open only Friday and Saturday nights right below our room2nd floor. Also this club is not owned by the hotel and you have to pay to get into it also open to 330am and LOUD.. There is nothing in the area for miles in which to have a top notch meal only fast food frightening at best to order. Shopping is very little. Not a very safe neighborhood. Driving there not very easy to find. If you are going to an NFL football game driving to game is actually very easy only about 5 minutes but to take any other means of transportation is way out of the way and expensive.	2.0
This hotel offers clean rooms, great service and is within walking distance of everything in Bricktown. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Parking is a little tricky when trying to locate the elevators. Otherwise, it was a nice hotel. Would definitely recommend!	5.0
Well, the grounds are well kept. pool was clean, and this was our third stay. Beds are ok, and the rooms served their purpose. Large tiled floors with some recycled furnishings from a popular strip hotel. It really wasnt a bad room. cheaper here for a week than 1 night on the strip. Bonus.. 8 feet to your room.. vs 1/2 mile on the strip!!! Not bad att all for a refirbished 1950's hotel, not too bad at all.

Having been to Sedona a number of times, we've stayed in quite a few different hotels over the years.

It's like any other hotel at this class but the staffs were friendly , room was clean full break-fast plenty of food and drink , the shuttle service to and from subway(metro) is free anytime you like , it's worth the cost of hotel fare.

My husband and I stayed here over the weekend to celebrate my birthday. The hotel was packed but that didn't seem to affect the staff. They were very friendly, attentive and accommodating. The breakfast in the morning was wonderful-full of choices and whenever they got low on something a staff member came and changed it out. I will be staying there again next time I vacation to Charleston!	5.0
I visit this hotel a few times a year and I'm always satisfied with the rooms.

Bad: Parking is probably the only downside. You have to park in a parking garage which is fine, but expensive. But I guess thats what you get for staying in the city. It was all worth it though because the location was amazing. Good: The location is amazing. We were able to walk to everything. The room was clean and comfortable for my family of 4. The free breakfast was also great. We had an issue with internet that was taken care of really quickly. We had a great time and look forward to staying again	5.0
I had stayed here for my girls night birthday celebration and I must say the room was very spacious and clean. The hotel staff was very pleasant and all the amenities we needed were right in this room. I will definitely be using this hotel in the future	5.0
Hampton Inns are my first choice wherever we go. I've reviewed other locations very favorably but this is the first time I have a slightly negative experience. The walls are VERY thin.

I requested a non smoking room. When I opened my door I could smell heavy scent is stale cigarettes and alcohol. Every thing in the room seemed dingy. So much so I had to go to the local grocery store and buy sanitation wipes.and come back clean my room. The AC did not work well at all. The next morning I go down to the breakfast and there is the front desk in the dining area yelling at a couple because they were eating there. And then he goes and gets another female employee and she goes over and starts yelling at them. Granted the couple were not guests of the hotel. But everyone knows you should put on a professional face at all times. The could have asked them quietly to follow them out. Then after work I returned to my room to find that the maids and come in but didn't even replace the towels. This is the worst experience at a hotel I have ever had. I will not be returning, and I do travel to DC about every other month for business. And this hotel will permanently be marked off my list. Needs a total face lift and brand new well trained staff. I would wipe it clean and start with a brand new clean slate... With everything.	1.0
It was a very lovely stay. The room was so beautiful! Beds so comfy!! Pool was so refreshing!! We will stay again! The thing that was troubling, was check-in with one person, part of information was not correct, when I mentioned this, she stated, well you are staying only one night, Let that go, she did mention it several times. Then was telling us, where the room was, kept pointing behind us and saying right back there, repeating it. We didn't look behind us, so she kept pointing, I said do you want us to look behind us to see where you are pointing Eye roll from her! Breakfast ends at 9 and don't take any food out of that area! Let it go. The best part was she informed us of check out, which was 10, not one minute after, repeated it and do we understand! My patience now about gone, about to ask for a manager and tell her a piece of my mind! My very calm my daughter, who is more patience then I just said thank you and took the keys from her. Walked away, went to our room, went to eat and a dip in the pool, let it that go! The night gentlemen, at your front desk was fabulous, the mini fridge started making noise, and sent someone up. We went to eat the pool, it was looked at it. To bad, that the noise had stop, so we both thought it was fixed. When I said something to the front desk (not same lady) that next morning, she said so very sorry and took the resort fee off. The stay was so very nice, had a beautiful garden area!!! Will stay again!!	5.0

We stayed here for 9 days for vacation purposes, so we experienced pretty much everything this hotel has to offer.It's location is great. It is right in front of Lake Union. Ask for a room looking towards the lake (floors 5 or higher): you will be rewarded with beautiful sunrises and sunsets. You will also see people kayaking and swimming. And Kenmore Air departs for its water seeing tours from there, so you can see plane lift ups and water landings: cool!As though that was not enough, you are 1 mile away from Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP Museum, Chihuli Gardens, etc).We had a car, so it was nice to find plenty of parking, even for SUVs. Unfortunately you will be charges 27/day.Rooms are very comfortable. The staff (all of it: reception, restaurant, housekeeping) makes a point of acknowledging customers in one way or another every time they see you. And Whenever you request something they deliver it rather quickly, regardless of the hour. The hotel has a swimming pool and a hot tub. Small both of them, but good enough.The restaurant is open for breakfast and dinner only. No complaints on the service: very good. Breakfast offerings are fine: from healthy choices (oatmeal, yogurt with granola, fruits, etc) to more elaborate ones. Variety is limited but decent and it is all prepared rather fast. Dinner options were not attractive to us. We found them a bit over priced for the quality and quantity. However, the hotel has a small market where you can find a few things to eat, assuming you do not want to go out for dinner.A few blocks away from the hotel there is a Starbucks and a McCormick Schmick's restaurant, both of them with waterfront viewing. And about 5 blocks away there is a Bartell drugs where you can find medicines, regular snacks and a few more sophisticated options (salads, Gouda cheese, prosciutto and good crackers, etc).All in all: great place to stay. I highly recommend it.	4.0
When I first pulled in the parking lot I seen furniture sitting outside of every room on the first floor, when I asked the front desk clerk about it he said they were remodeling. We found hair in the sheets so we asked the clerk for new sheets and he couldn't locate any. The next morning we went to front desk and the clerk told us tocall corporate. Later that night is when we discovered that we were actually being bitten by bed bugs not only were we bit we saw them with our own eyes I lifted the pillow from under my husband and seen one tiny bug,then I started to examine my daughters bed and I spotted a huge one.	1.0
My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Saint Hotel in Key West recently. The room was beautiful, the staff very friendly and helpful. We loved the balcony overlooking the pool. We really think there should be a mirror in the room so that two people can get ready at the same time, rather than having to wait for the bathroom steam to clear before the other person can get ready to go out. We did have to ask for towels and toilet tissue the second day, but the staff were quick to bring them to us. We also received extra hangers when we asked for them definitely needed more hangers! We thought the location was perfect, and the bikes were a treat also. We did lose WiFi, Tv, and music due to some sort of work going on in the street. It all came back on after a while. We enjoyed our stay at the Saint and would definitely stay there again! Jim Lois HoganMr. Mrs. Hogan, thank you so much for taking time our and reviewing our property. We greatly appreciate all the kind words about the hotels rooms, location and staff. I think its a wonderful idea about having a second mirror in the rooms we will definitely take it into advisement because it would enhance the experiment. Should you travel to Key West in the near future we hope you will consider The Saint Hotel Key West as your next residence. Thank You once again	4.0
I can't say enough good things about this hotel. First off the staff ---every single staff member--- was helpful, courteous and went out of their way to go extra mile to make sure our stay was great. The housekeeper even took the time to arrange my kids stuffed animals in fun and creative ways. Second this was the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed at. I'm a slight germ a phobe so hotel rooms can bother me. I was so comfortable in the room because it was so clean. Third, the breakfast was good and had a nice variety. Lastly the little touches like the lemon water at foyer, the milk and cookies at 8 each night and the treasure box for the kids at check out all made the stay extra memorable. Thank you for a wonderful stay. Heather	5.0

Stayed at Club Quarters Downtown in April. I was initially disappointed with the size/layout of my room, so went right back to the front desk to complain (rooms are small but clean and staff is helpful). Virginia, the gal at the desk apologized and instantly moved me to a room with a view of Chicago River. Since it was my first visit to Chicago I asked Virginia about things to do in the area. She inquired about my interests and 10 minutes later I had tickets for Wicked, one of the hottest shows in town, dinner reservations at Vivo, trendy Italian restaurant in the theater district. Next day Virginia suggested a trip to the Art Institute, only a 10 minute walk from the hotel! , walk in Lincoln Park and a very pleasant restaurant for dinner with live jazz . What a great city! I enjoyed my stay tremendously. Will be back, thanks again Virginia!	5.0
Over priced, old, and gross. We arrived in our very small room to towels that someone with a bad cold blew their nose in. Yes, that was left for us. The front desk laughed when they saw it.

Lots of activity under way to improve the hotel. They have some new eating places coming in soon. The new Game Place sports bar had great food and drinks. The bartender Angela was friendly and helpful.Rooms are spacious and quiet. Beds were comfortable when you are finally ready to crash. My room was clean and no complaints about maid service,I used the shuttle service to return to the airport and this was a nice savings over a cab or rental car.Downside / upside is that this is a LONG way from the strip. You can walk to a few places. A few gold courses are next door, with Angel Park and Badlands on either side. I would not want to stay here more than two nights without a car to get out more.The players club had ZERO points gifts except in small or medium sizes. How is that possible. F minus. Many employees were friendly and helpful. Room rates were very reasonable compared to the Strip.	3.0

A hip vibe and soothing lounge music greet you at this fairly new, white-clad, 36-room property located steps from Duval Street, the main drag in Key West. Staff seem a bit over-taxed at times but they bend over backward to assist with everything from meals, room service, taxis, and logistics. Service was excellent, starting with the smiling assistance of bellman Gustavo, who is helpful, not to mention easy on the eyes. Rooms are simply decorated in a modern white motif with blue accents. Blue lighting predominates on the exterior, too. Many of the rooms open with balconies and patios to a lap-style pool crowned by a waterfall and Buddha at one end. Careful - they do have some rooms accurately billed as petite that would be cramped for a couple. My Superior King was spacious enough and comfortable, and was part of the new remodel/construction. You may want to request a newer room. The location cannot be beat. It sits in a relatively quiet block of the otherwise clamorous Duval Street. Through a side gate you step right onto Duval. Go left and hit all the iconic bars from Hemingway days. Go right and there are more of the same, including all of the gay bars and clubs that are only 4 to 6 blocks away. I walked to the marina for several excursions, to the southernmost point and south beaches. The hotel has bikes available at no charge. I only needed a taxi to get to the airport and far-off marinas for some of my excursions. Overall, this property served me well. Its common spaces are chic and modern, the rooms are comfortable, and the people working there make things as easy as possible.Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay with us. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your time and the amenities of our property! We will be sure to pass along all of your kind words to our employees so that they know their hard work is appreciated. Please, come back and see us!	5.0

The hotel is ideally located in center city across the street from Reading Terminal market. They did a nice job modernizing this hotel. It is also very clean. Check in was great. I was in town for the night and booked a room last minute. I had 4 adults in one room and when I booked the only available option was 1 queen and 1 sofa bed in a room. I asked if they have any rooms available with 2 beds and they were able to accommodate me last minute which was great. Also at checkin they provided 2 cold bottles of water which was a nice touch. The room was very clean nice. The rooms have a full refrigerator, sink, microwave, dishwasher, coffee machine. The bathroom is simple, my room had a standing shower with a glass door. The pool was simple and on the smaller side. Parking like every other hotel is expensive and you will find better options searching on your phone to park yourself. The complimentary breakfast was solid, they offer waffles,yogurt, juice, prepackaged omlets and breakfast sandwiches that were very good.

Initially, I was a bit apprehensive because of the price of the parking and the lack of photos of the front and street view of the hotel. But I was very relieved by the parking garage around the corner of the hotel which costed 14.00 versus 42.00 for hotel valet parking. I was pleased with the location of the hotel as it was very conveniently located near a great restaurant (Nandos), a 24 hour CVS and a Whole Foods market. The staff at the hotel were very friendly from the moment we approached the outside of the hotel to the front desk, life guard at the pool and servers during the free breakfast. Great experience!	4.0

This hotel was great. The staff was genuinely nice and helpful. My boyfriend and I came for a trip to the Verizon Center to catch a Wizards game. The Verizon Center was not far at all. I called front desk for a cab and had one in about 5 minutes. The room was clean and nice. I'm a bit of a germaphobic and I had no problem with it. I didn't spot one dirty spot or anything. When we first got in the room there was a problem with the heat. Maintenance came and fixed it quickly and all was well. If I had to list one improvement it would be that the furniture looks a little outdated. But it was not really a problem. It didn't look dirty or run down, just not fashionable. Other than that, this hotel was wonderful. It was in a great location to restaurants and DC and I would absolutely stay here again.	5.0
Front desk staff really embodied the aloha spirit. Chech in/out was the smoothest process I ever experienced. And they took the time to customize our accommodations. Heated pool and fresh homemade waffles at continental breakfast was an unexpected treat. Hotel is energy concious which I loved about them. And what's not to love Great location + great service great time.	5.0
We had a room on the top Floor. Which was nice because you could see the sea It was very spacious and very clean. And a cosy fireplace. The room was up to date as well.

For the most part we enjoyed our stay. We thought our room was much bigger as thats how it seemed advertised online and we also thought the lobby area would be bigger. We got stuck on the elevator had to pull the doors open ourselves to exit the elevator on the morning after our first nights stay. The staff was not very communicative about the elevator issues and did not really provide any real direction about updates /or ways to return to our rooms using another means other than the elevator.	3.0

The hotel is listed as near Bricktown. I guess that would depend on your definition of near. Near to me would be near the Pilot truckstop as it was next door. Our room was clean, but you could walk to the pool an see other rooms that were not. Many had mattresses propped up against the wall, and almost all the second floor rooms had pillows stuffed in the a/c units. You could see all this through the windows of the parking lot because lots of the sliding glass door curtains were open or missing pieces. It honestly looked like they were fixing it one room at a time. I don't know how old the hotel is, but it is far from being completely renovated. I think hotels.com should do more research on the hotels they show with a 4 star rating. The two star the hotel showed was more accurate.	2.0
Very large rooms, well decorated, large bathrooms. Public spaces are chic. Rooftop pool and restaurant are scenes and fun. Not too stuffy. Nicest upper end hotel in area. Definitely now my go to on West Side	5.0
OH MY! We had no idea what to expect, but when we arrived, we were BLOWN away. Staff goes out of their way to be friendly. Martisha at the front desk made a first impression that never wavered.

Small, lackluster, local owned motel literally next door to the Wall Drug and other shops and eateries on Main Street.

NOT shabby chic, just shabby. We had stayed at the Chelsea in the past and expected the Annex to be at least similar. But it was more like a downgraded, poorly maintained motel 6 trading on the good name of the Chelsea. Check in took 25 minutes waiting in line. The first room had high basement type windows (that were broken and didn't lock) looking over the roof where the air handlers were. The second room had a broken lock on the patio door. The patio was flooded, the dresser was chipped, stained, and drawers wouldn't stay closed, the bathroom door was water damaged at the bottom and stained, the bathroom floor was stained and dirty. Both rooms we saw were shabby and desperately in need of upgrades. The elevator floor was damaged and missing tiles, the restaurant downstairs (which was cute and hip in the past) is now old and shabby also. Not worth the money. As it is now, I would not recommend this hotel at all.	1.0
Some years ago,my father in-law selected this hotel and we had a great time. After he stopped going the rest of us went down again but stayed somewhere else. Big mistake ,so this time it was without question as to where we were going. This will be our spot every year for a week. The people are great as well.	5.0

This was the most reasonably priced hotel. It is understaffed to say the least. Night desk clerk did not charge me for a roll away I needed for 1 night. This is where the good news ends. Each day we had to ask for something that should have been in our room, towels, shampoo etc. Our last night there, we stood in a long line to ask for the cups that were not replaced during housekeeping. I was given the address to Wal-mart to go and buy my own! During breakfast they ran out of spoons, cereal was eaten with a fork. I wish management would train and hire additional employees for better customer service!	2.0

We love Drury Inns and were pleased with our stay in Atlanta. The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean, and spacious. Breakfast, though crowded this day, was good and well stocked. One employee was even helping people make waffles. We were also pleased that we could park for up to 7 days for free (subject to available space). We only had to fill out a form, which did clearly state that the hotel is not liable for any damages. That seemed fair enough, and we had no problems with our car while it was parked at the hotel for 3 nights. The location was very convenient to the airport (right off I-85) and the free shuttle service brought us right back to the hotel in minutes.	5.0

The Saint is about as well located as any place in key west. There are 2 (hidden) side entrances/exits as well as the main one on Eaton street. if you use a gps, DO NOT enter the Duval street address -- you will end up going in circles.Main entrance is up a few steps. you can park in front for 15 minutes, and if you have luggage, go inside and ask for help.room 113 is on the main floor, and mostly dark since the shutters need to be kept shut during the daytime (there is a busy walkway right outside and anyone can see in -- for same reason, it can be a bit noisy at times)the entire property is funky, in a playful way. photos on this site will show you why.staff is friendly and anxious to please. any major problems should go to the general manager, abraham, who is eager to make the hotel as good as possible.oh, the location. no car is needed. you are 5 minute walk to truman white house, 10 minutes or less to mallory park/sunset pier. also greene street is the same area and has a lively night life as well as key lime pie stores every few steps.hemingway house is towards the other end of Duval street, but can be reached in less than 20 minutes if you don't stop at all the stores and eateries along this main street. go another 10 minutes or less, and you will be at the end of Duval, and reach the southernmost point in the continental u.s. -- where the famous buoy sits. you may need to wait on line a few minutes to take a photo at that spot. also, a great cafe right on the beach there. finally, for dinner, you can almost throw a dart and find a terrific place within walking distance of the saint. have fun!Dear ischloss,We greatly appreciate that you took the time to write such a thorough review about your recent stay at The Saint Hotel Key West. We hope that when your travels bring you back to Key West, you will once again choose The Saint and give us another to earn that 5-star rating!Cheers!	4.0

Where to begin!!! What a filthy rat trap hotel.Literally.In my bathroom window there was edible RAT poison in the open,not to mention the 1 inch Gap under the front door.Upon arrival the parking lot looked like a dump yard.Toilets,mattress',TV's,bottles,condom wrappers were everywhere.The room smelled terrible,I've seen thicker paper towels the the rags in the bathroom.I was afraid to put my bag on the carpet. Fortunately there was a table to leave my bag on. The clincher was on our way out to dinner a maroon cadilac pulls up a 4 of the most disgusting prostitutes get out ready to ply there trade.I stood there in amazement while the pimp told them exactly what was expected of them that nigh,. Again,Please DO NOT STAY HERE	1.0
Very old hotel that caters to low class clientele. Being near Disneyland, this hotel is a fly trap to families who cannot afford something nicer. There were children running around all hours of the night and day and the hotel staff did nothing to keep them quiet. Our first night there we had a family above us with small children who kept running around the room and because of the noise we assume they were jumping off the furniture. We complained to the hotel staff and nothing was done to stop this. It continued until well after 11 PM and night.The second night we were there, we had a family with small children next door to us and it was apparent from what we saw, they were there with other families who also had small children. They were kept there doors open and the children were running up and down the balcony with no supervision. At 6 AM the next morning, someone was pounding on the door next to us very loudly and yelling fire, fire, fire. It woke up the people next to us so they opened there door and began to play loud rap music until about approximately 9 AM when we left. We were on the second floor near the office and all of this activity was extremely loud and had to have been heard at the office, but no action was taken to stop it.I would never stay at this hotel again!!!!Thank you for taking the time to write us a review. We are extremely sorry for the experience you had at our hotel. This is not something normal. I am also suprised our staff did not address the issue immediately. W hope you will give us another chance in the future to win back your business.	1.0
As a frequent traveler, I have come to view the Hampton Inns as the best value for comfort when away from home. They are uniformly situated, making each nights stay as familiar as my own home.

Each time I've stayed, the rooms have been clean and comfortable. However, there was no record of my reservation on 2nd trip (made through Expedia), and on recent trip overheard conversation with another guest experiencing the same problem, and his issue was not so much with the lost reservation as with the attitude of the hotel staff. My experience on trip 2 was similar but not quite as contentious. Most competing hotels do not charge for breakfast. This one does.	4.0
When we first got to the Hotel I was parallel parking and A bum try to pretend to get hit by me. Then asked me for money. Then we checked in an that was painless. We got to our room and I felt like I was in a crack house. Our reservation said a balcony which there was not. The windows were so high that you couldn't see out side unless you stood on a chair. It felt like we were in a dungeon but we were on the second floor. No fridge ,no safe. It looked like someone stole the fridge.	1.0

This hotel is located across the river from the Trump Hotel which makes it walkable to Michigan Ave, Millenium Park and possibly even Navy Pier. Rooms are nice, sleek and clean but SMALL. How often have you stayed at a hotel and asked for a late checkout Has any hotel wanted to charge you for it Well, this hotel charges 35 for late checkout! We had a situation, where my mom, a senior, was traveling with me and was injured the nite of our stay at an outing. We ended up having to go the hospital emergency room and didn't return to our room until 3:00 am. When we woke at 11:00 am, we were hoping they'd allow us a late check out so we'd have time to get some food, especially since she is diabetic. The hotel would make no exception or allowance. We had to hurry and pack. We'd prefer to have eaten and then packed up. Because of this insensitivity I've had to lower the rating of the hotel.	3.0

As being a guest in Chicago, you can afford the luxury of spending a couple of hours on the architectural tour through downtown Chicago. The first building they tell you about is the River hotel. Situated opposite the Trump tower, you get a feeling of the grandeur of the 1920s, when the hotel was build. It must have had the same strange feeling, you now get from the Trump tower. Ugly, grotesque, aiming at the very rich and symbolizing something which does not exist and proves to be a dream. While we now call the building historical nostalgia with its weird toptower as of floor 24, the hotel offers a mixture of the old and the new. The old is the buildings shape and elevators, the various signs and sometimes not well maintained emergency staircases. The new offering a business floor, the tiny modernized reception room, the good quality Wi-Fi and free water they serve. And it is this indecisiveness which makes or breaks this hotel. Either do the modern streak or go completely back into the history of 1920's. We were staying on a high floor and really getting in the top of the building, you are offered small floors with smaller rooms. Due to the height, rooms tend to be windy even with closed windows. The room was ok, but why this old fashioned ugly bathroom Why do they forget a bedside table and when asked for and promised, the thing, it never showed up Why have a decent desk but not enough electricity points To be fair the prices are reasonable for downtown Chicago but the hotel just misses the finesses to make it to a four star. The view from the window was amazing but the cold wind chilled up the room sometimes to an uncomfortable temperature. My advice would be stay low.Hello LowieSantiagoChile,Thank you for providing us with feedback on your stay.

The hotel had a convenient location, right outside of the interstate and 5 minutes from the metro station. The front desk people were okay but it seems like they are always in a hurry - from checking in, checking out or even just asking a question. The breakfast was great, it was a hot breakfast not just bagels and hotcakes. We had eggs, grits, sausages and such. The cleaning ladies were awesome! Every time we got back to the hotel after lunch, our room was already made and our towels changed. The shuttle driver, Sam, was awesome too! He made the drive to the metro very fun and was very helpful. Again, if not for the front desk people, this hotel would be great!	3.0
