Everything about our stay was great. Traveling with 2 young children can be challenging but we felt welcome and comfortable at this hotel. The rooms were small but nice, the pool was fun for the kids and we were able to walk to the Pier and several restaurants. Overall, it was a great experience.	5.0
Its well worth what you pay. The pool is the hugest I have seen at a hotel! The staff is polite and friendly. Some kinda shortage of housekeepers and waited two hours on checking into a reserved room. Once there it was good we booked a double with a kitchenette. Spacious and convienient. Will be returning.	4.0
I have stayed at this Hilton Garden Inn a few times. It has a very convenient location to the Raritan Center and many restaurant options. It is always clean and the staff is excellent. The hot tub is really hot.	5.0

The hotel I stayed is so-called a 3-star hotel, here was no hot water in my room and I couldn't take shower.

I took my significant other to Springhill Suites for a weekend of relaxation for his birthday and I was very disappointed. When we decided to lay down there was a blood stain on 2 different sheets. We also did not use the shower because it was a grey film covering the bottom of the bathtub. I also think there was a laundry room next to us due to all of the noise and banging early in the morning. Overall, the cleanliness of the room was a problem, but the front desk staff was very friendly!! oh and I could've done without the breakfast!!	1.0
The room had a very comfortable bed and a nice rain shower. The room was the perfect size and not too cramped. The fitness center was very nice.

Bad: No soap available, just shower gel. No hot water for three days. Good: Super room 10 on third floor. Loved the squishy soft duvet. Excellent staff tried very hard to help us with many things. Even had help signing up to Uber for the first time! Made good use of the pool.	5.0
Bad: Street noise. Good: Decor, table games, dining	4.0
We had to be up in the area Buffalo/Niagara Falls for a new business venture and we didn't want to spend a fortune so we chose this property. From the front desk to the breakfast and most comfortable bed, our stay there was exceptional. I would totally recommend to anyone looking for a great place to stay!!	5.0
Staff was very helpful and courteous.	5.0
Bad: Room smelled, mattress was thin and hard. Clerk changed my rate to higher price when we arrived saying we got wrong rate. Charged more than was quoted on booking. Gave us a map and I guess they get a lot of complaints because it says FYI hotel built on 1989. Bring your own toiletries. Very little lighting in room and no electric plugs. Everything was plugged into an extension cord. Good: Location and parking.	2.0
Somehow my booking.com reservation have not reached the hotel so had to wait about half an hour while it was submitted again. Room spacious and clean, heater efficient but pretty noisy, noise from corridor is also thereService could be better - at 0130 at night got a phone call from night manager to immediately re-park the car (evening manager allowed the parking at particular slot). It was outrageousWifi was great and coffee available. For very reasonable price and 1 night stay you can't wish for better	4.0
Horrible service. Run down. Over-priced. Even the shower curtain was the wrong width (too narrow) for the shower. Sink clogged. Stains on furniture. Just gross.

The lady who owns the place was very nice, the room we had was great, and we enjoyed our stay.

I really enjoyed my stay at The River Hotel! It had a great location. Our room overlooked the Chicago River and we were directly across from Trump Tower. Very cool. The hotel was also within walking distance to almost everything we wanted to do (Millenium Park, Shedd aquarium, the Field Museum, Magnificent Mile, food, etc.). One of my favorite features of the hotel was the free bottles of water. It was nice to grab a bottle and fill it up before heading out for the day. I will definitely be recommending this hotel to any friends traveling to Chicago!	4.0

My girlfriends and I celebrated there BIRTHDAY and Recovery in Bmore. It was our first time in the hotel. The staff was excellent especially the Manager(Rozellen) She very helpful in given us the best restaurant and clubs to go to..Only bad thing I didn't like was paying too much for valet parking it was very costly... But overall it was close to the harbor the other end by Fells Street which was great small local shops and bars. If you looking for different view of Baltimore this hotel is where u need to be.. We shall be back in June	5.0

Nice clean hotel, undergoing some renovations. The staff was very helpful and the breakfast was good , many choices such as waffles, scrambled eggs, sausage and gravy as well as yogurt and hot food was hot.

Not only myself, but my family loved this hotel and we will return again. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants good service as well as a nice, clean hotel stay:) The rooms were excellent and very comfortable. The breakfast buffet was awesome and I loved the pool/jaccuzi and computer room. Onsite laundry is recommended as well as the room service. Great location as there were many restaurants nearby. If I could change anything, it would be the structure of the hotel room (to include more privacy for a family of four...door or divider). Best hotel I've stayed at in a very long time!	5.0
Dropped by Pittsburgh overnight on the way to DC. Marriott staff bent over backwards to accommodate us by upgrading our room to two double beds. Bell staff went above and beyond to guide us to PNC Park to take in a Pirates game. Excellent stay!	5.0

We are fans of the Hilton and Hampton Inn hotel chain. Have stayed at many of the properties throughout the US. The positives for the hotel...

Quality of this hotel is exceptional. Arguably the best service and quality of room, restaurants and bar that we have ever experienced. The restaurant for breakfast was great and the bar at cocktail time was typical of a New York happy hour, loud and happy.Dear Richard K, We appreciate your review on TripAdvisor of our hotel and we are delighted that you have made The St. Regis Hotel your new home away from home. We will share with our team your praises and we are thankful for your visit. Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager	5.0

Was promised early check-in...didn't get it. One room was partially cleaned. Restaurant was extremely slow, the food was mediocre and pricey. Internet was really slow. Self parking for only 24 per day. Four or five star priced hotel for a two star (at the most) venue.	2.0

Pleasant check in, room.smelled.like stale smoke, a few dead bugs on the Floor and had to go through a swarm.to enter the room. There were red stains on.the door that seemed odd..dead bugs Building is fairly.dated but room was updated except.for the bed condition. It was not comfortable at all. The shower was good, hot and strong. Breakfast was very nice and goes until 10am. they needed more seating though for guests. Not a bad hotel..would.probably choose a different one next time.	2.0
This motel is right on the main strip in Cherokee and easy to get in and out of. The front desk was always pleasant and facilities were clean and well maintained.

We enjoyed our stay. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Although the pool hours didn't accommodate our after 10 P.M. arrival, the bartender still served us the length of time we needed to relax after our long journey. Rooms were great, although we wished for an exhaust fan in the bath. 3 people needing showers in the morning necessitated this feature. Overall, we were pleased with our experience.	5.0
The pool is huge my kids love that it is seven foot deep so they can dive in. The hotel is being remodeled and the room they have redone are quite nice, the beds are very comfortable. The staff is also friendly and welcoming.	4.0

This hotel is in an awful area, and the pictures make it look really nice, in reality the pool is tiny and next to a car park, the water was freezing, and the general customer base at breakfast was a little out of my comfort zone.

Everything went as planned. Nice free breakfast. The free WiFi was a bit slow, the TV/Cable had some quirks but was manageable (no HD). The pool was bath temperature (Very Warm!).

I travel to New Orleans for business about once a month and have the privilege of staying in quite a few hotels in NOLA, but Aloft was a standout, even though is it located very close to most attractions, the staff left us with a bad taste in our mouths. At check in, we were helped by Jermal and it was the worst check in experience I've ever had (even at Motel 6 they at least make eye contact with you and answer your questions). Very cold and not friendly staff with the exception of the valet guys. They were very nice and professional. Once we got to our room, it was clean and spacious. I did not find anything wrong with it except the infamous bad water pressure in the shower and the fact that we only had 2 big towels (All hotels I've stayed at have had 4 big towels) We signed up for the SPG Green Choice at check in so the extra towels would had been nice and we actually never received the 5 vouchers for making the green choice. Aloft has a lot of potential because of their location. I am giving them another chance in late May, hopefully this time they listen to our requests and are more customer oriented.Thank you for staying with us this past week. I would like to apologize for your disappointment during your recent stay with us. I know we certainly have not met your expectations and we want so much to gain back your trust and loyalty. The feedback you provided will allow us to address specific information and in turn provide a superior service for our guests both now and in the future. It is unfortunate that you had a negative experience but we look forward to having you back here with us in May so we can show you how we have used your feedback and show you the hospitality our talent is truly made of!If I can do anything in the meantime, please contact me directly at Dixie.Kraussaloftneworleansdowntown.com.	2.0

We chose the place partly part of the bad reviews, we suspected that peoples' complaints might be a little silly and we were right. The room is comfortable, clean, fresh and new. The staff is friendly. Breakfast is nothing to write home about, but it's not important as there's a Denny's right next door.	4.0

My 18 year old nephew and I recently spent 3 nights at Courtyard-Lake Union. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff was especially helpful and friendly.

The surrounding area has a lot of construction currently but other than that the location is great. It is within walking distance of the Space Needle. I would definitely choose this hotel again.	4.0

The familial Ohana spirit of Hawaii is exuded by the staff of Ocean Tower Hotel in Waikiki. My fiance and I have made 3 trips in total to Honolulu and this by far was the best experience with a hotel there because of the very warm welcome and service provided by the staff at the Ocean Tower Hotel.Leonor in particular (and as mentioned by numerous reviews here) made us feel more 'at home' than at home.Also, as mentioned by previous reviewers, the hotel is undergoing renovations to update and modernize their rooms. The renovations were not felt or noticed by us... there was no noise and construction people noticed during our stay 05/19-05/26. We got a personal glimpse of some of the completed new rooms and what we saw indicated 5 star quality.. tile floors, Asian influenced decor, new furnishings, state of the art TV and projectors, lighting, top of the line bathroom fixtures. Once available (by end of the year we were told), I am selfishly hoping the rates would not be too different as I would love to come back to stay in those new rooms!Everyday after an exhaustive tour or beach excursion during our stay, we were extremely impressed by the clean bedding, clean bathroom and air conditioned room we returned to. Not once did we have a single complaint about the room or hotel facilities. We did at one point need the use of a microwave to heat some food and the hotel staff was happy to allow us the use of theirs.	5.0
Excellent customer service and very easy check in process. The rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable. The location is great for not only the convention center, but is a quick subway trip or walking distance to most of Philadelphia most famous attractions. And having the Reading Terminal Market directly across the street is a great added bonus. There are several very good dining choices very close by. The added security of having to use your room key to enter the hotel and use the elevator is a great feature. Overall, this was a great hotel stay and recommend using Home2 Suites.

Clean hotel, friendly service, but breakfast isn't included. This hotel is located outside BWI airport, which is great if you're flying out of BWI. But being about 10 or so miles outside Baltimore, it made it extremely inconvenient to get to downtown Baltimore from here. The light-rail train took us almost an hour from Penn Station, and that was just to get to BWI, not even to the area where all the hotels are. Really inconvenient without a car.	4.0

Meet my needs for a hotel near the airport. Hotel shuttle to airport convenient, included breakfast available at 5:30 am, room was comfortable and clean.

The breakfast was the only disappointment. Hard boiled eggs,sausage that the attendant had to warm in the microwave and add to the serving dish and then it was not hot. I was surprised to see her put the freshly warmed on top of the sausage already in the pan that was serving temperature. I was taught to remove old and place new in bottom and first cooked on top. The area is very small also. Train is close when it comes by in the night and may disturb others but we like trains.	4.0
Stayed at the Charles Hotel over Christmas / New Year with the family. The room, staff and hotel in general were brilliant. I particularly recommend the hotel restaurant, Henrietta's Table, serves marvellous locally-sourced food.	5.0

My wife and I have stayed at the Bay Pointe Inn several times in the past 6 years that we have been married. We stayed there the night of our wedding and as anniversary stays on a couple occasions.

Absolutely like the laminate floors in the rooms instead of carpeting. You can sense clean instead of what can be in carpeting. Rooms are pretty standard fare but not cramped.

Nice place convenient to airport before or after a flight. Airport shuttle between airport and hotel. Parking available short and long term. Comfortable room with sofa and work desk. Good burger place just across the parking lot.	5.0
The rooms were clean, but the hotel was more functional than inviting. The pool was small and always occupied(if more then 7 people in was crowded, it seemed) so we did not use it. Our family lived close by so it was convenient but is in middle of nowhere(although the area is being built up) if the feel was less functional and more inviting then I would have given 5's the breakfast was worth the extra money I paid for the rooms(as compared to another hotel without it).	3.0

My sister came into town so we decided to go to The National Harbor for a night. Checking in, the hotel staff was very pleasant. Parking is in a garage behind the hotel, for 18. Our room was clean with nice views. The bed was very comfortable. We were able to walk comfortably to the harbor and sightsee. There are also restaurants and bars within walking distance. Breakfast was great, with canadian bacon and sausage patty meat options. There was also a waffle station, eggs, potatoes, fruit, yogurt, cereal, muffins, and other pastries. Checkout was a breeze, and the front desk staff again, was very pleasant. I very much enjoyed my stay and I will definitely return!	4.0

We stayed for one night while attending a wedding. Cons: The AC in the room had to be set to 62* from the air to work at all. Even set at 62*, the room felt 70-72*. The bathroom is very dated. The shower/tub didn't work properly. And there is no light specifically for the shower room. There is one switch that controls both the vanity and the shower. No continental breakfast. You're only option is (overpriced) Minerva's. Pros: Very nice staff. The rooms are very clean. It's near Thunder Road.	4.0
The building looks beautiful the lobby too. They upgraded me to a room with 2 bedrooms, 3 tvs and 2 baths! I was ecstatic at first. But more things wrong than I've ever encountered in 1 hotel room: 1. The a/c, even when set to 65, was warmish, and only blowed in the entryway, not in the bed area.2. The light next to the bed was linked to the entry light: if you wanted the bed light to work, you had to have that hall light on. If you turned that off, the bed light went off too.3. No ironing board!4. Nothing to put the soap on, just the bathroom counter. That's icky.5. The bedspread was cool looking, but not something I'd like to sit on or sleep under. But if I peeled that away there was just the sheet. 6. That entryway was dark, even with its one light turned on.7. The counter with the coffee machine was dark too, even with the light turned on.8. Get rid of coffee dispensed in those plastic cup thingies - so bad for the environment!I lost count after that, but you get the idea. All these things could be tweaked and it would be a good place.	2.0
I spent 2 nights in this hotel with friends for a bachelor party. It would have taken very little for this hotel to meet our needs and it still fell short.

Only staff that was friendly was the evening desk person. The Red Lion Inn Suites Manager McMinnville, OR is very VERY rude! Crystal!! We attempted to cancel our second night due to changes in our travel plans. A few hours after we checked in we were told checking out a day early was no problem so we made a reservation at another hotel a few hours further south in OR. When we went to check out we were told by Crystal that we would not be getting a refund for the second night because we were a pre-pay. She insisted that it was Expedia that would not permit the refund. She also said it was hotel policy that since it was a prepay the second night could not be refunded!! I called Expedia, and they tried to get the Crystal to release us from the second night and they were told NO, and Expedia had no choice but to honor the hotel policy. So now we had two hotel reservations. Fortunately Expedia was able to cancel the reservation we had made at the other hotel (without penalty). We later checked the hotel policy on-line and it did not say anything regarding no refund for cancelling a second night, only first night or no shows!! We brought this to Crystals attention, and she just said hmmm, Ill check into that. No apologies, no managerial flexibility in resolving our customer dissatisfaction, and she talked to us as if we were children. Red Lion did not care about our needs, only about selling out the hotel!! We doubt we will never stay at another Red Lion.	2.0
Perfect hotel! Indoor pool, Hot tube, clean, comfortable, staff was friendly.

I must say that the hotel met my standards of comfort, space but cleanliness was not so good. The housekeeping staff must be retrained and maybe the hotel should hire dedicated people to clean rooms thoroughly. I found 2 bags of trash in the cabinet from previous tenants (SURPRISED FACE)and the shower curtain was in poor condition. This discovery made me feel that the hotel staff zips in and out rooms, and not cleaning properly.	4.0

"We we checked into the hotel, the lady was not very friendly and seemed to be lacking some customer service training. We had to let the water run for, at leas,t 5 minutes before taking a warm (not hot) shower. Also,the t.v. reception kept going in and out. The hotel was not kid/family friendly at all. The only restaurant available for breakfast was a ""sports bar"" that either sat 2 or 6 people and all the tables were the pub style which does not work very well for a 1 and 3 year old. The only option the staff gave us was to eat at another hotel restaurant."	2.0

The guest service informed me that my service dog would not be able to stay in the handicap accessible room with me. He offered me a pet friendly room, but it was not accessible. (I use a wheelchair so this was an unreasonable option!) He finally contacted a supervisor, who ok'd staying in the accessible room with my dog. Upon entering the room, the room was very tight. It was nearly impossible to maneuver past the bed. As a matter of fact, I didn't. In the bathroom, the toilet sat on the middle of the wall, nothing as far as grab bars. For a customer with balance issues, this makes it hard to toilet independently. It was frustrating that the room is considered to be accessible! I would be happy to consult with you to ensure that rooms are made accessible!	1.0

My complaint is that after you check in, they take you over to their concierge desk and proceed to try and sell you on a time share meeting. And hey, if you want to pay for a room and then spend two hours of your time at a time share meeting, more power to you. I don't. And I tried to be polite about it, because I believe in treating people in the service industry as you want to be treated. I understood it was part of her job and politely told her that I wasn't interested. And the first lady seemed cool about it. Then what seemed to be her supervisor came over and offered me free stuff to go to the meeting. I still said no. She proceeded to get really patronizing. By the fifth time I'm saying no, I start to not feel so polite. And when the same woman calls me up the next night in my room to try and pressure me again into going to this meeting, I just had no patience for it. I loved the room. I loved the size and the cleanliness. I hated that they repeatedly badgered me about a stupid time share meeting. I didn't pay for a hotel room to be pressured to buy a time share. If it hadn't been for that, I'd have had no problem being a repeat customer. I don't like being pressured into something I say no to. And now, a month later, I just got a call from the hotel group, again trying to get me to go to a time share meeting. Luckily, the guy was way more understanding and only made me say no once.	3.0
My husband and I stayed at this hotel overnight on our way back from a trip to NC from PA. We arrived after the normal check-in time, but we had to wait a few minutes for our room to be ready. After we settled in for the evening, one of the neighboring rooms occupants were having an argument. They proceeded to slam their door and yell in the hallway on and off for 30 minutes. They were loud enough to wake my husband over the television. When we left our room the next morning, the hallway reeked of marijuana and cheap air freshener. We were getting an early start on our traveling and even though the hotel offered a continental breakfast, nothing was available (not even coffee) before 7:00 am.	3.0
I always joke with my parents since this is their hotel. My wife and I stayed there two nights and I have to say it was excellent. Room view was great. Lots to do for families (bowling, movies, arcade). Clearly not a Paris, Caesers, Belligio but then the prices aren't either. Lots of elderly people mixed in with families. It was a good change of pace from the strip and an entirely different feel (thats good and bad).	4.0
We made our third overnight stop at this hotel in 2015 and once again were very pleasured with it. The rooms have been very clean, the staff welcoming and attentive, and the breakfast better than most continental breakfasts.	5.0
There was a free breakfast buffet, but the hotel did not let us know the hours of it. When we showed up at 9:32, they said it closed at 9:30. We reserved a king sized bed and got a room with two doubles. They told us we were not guaranteed the bed choice that we wanted. There is no restaurant, lounge or bar as it says on the website. The shuttle was good to use and runs pretty much every 30 minutes up to 4:30 ish. If you need to return to the hotel after 10:10 when the shuttle stops, take a taxi. The cost was 7.50 and it was worth it. The nearest metro station is too far from D.C. Next time I will stay at the Virginian Suites in Arlington again.	2.0

The motel was 10 min fro the metro station. It was very convenient. A safeway was about 2 blocks away, (don't go to the Prospect Market--very expensive) The room was large enough for all six of us, the kitchen was adequate and saved us a lot of money. It was good we booked through hotels.com becasue we heard a few other customers fighting with the staff over their bill. When we checked out they said we were all paid and there was our reciept. The workout room was nice, the bathroom near the workout room hadn't been remodeled yet. There is internet but it didn't work very fast, they said they were updating it. No pay for view movies, but a nice big flat screened tv. Overall I would stay there again, loved the location and the fact it had a kitchen	5.0

Well, I'm stayed in much better motels and some worse, though I made do with this one. First off they put me in a room that had not been serviced since the last guest. Walked in and like wow, is someone in here! Obviously they were long gone but not a good feeling. Called the front desk and they put me in another room. My new room seemed clean, though motel in general is a little run down. Motel itself is actually 3 separate buildings and I was in the south one. Area is fine and I felt safe walking around outside at night. Couple of real good honky tonks right next door (recommend Nashville Palace), though down side if you want peace and quiet you won't get it until they close up at around 2am. The outside pool is across the parking lot right up beside a Bar and Grill (Scoreboard - another fine honky tonk), though not like I was going to partake in outside pool in January anyway though is strange where the pool is located. By far the best about this motel is the location. Everything you need is within walking distance. All in all it was okay though not sure I would take family to stay there, though good for just me and would stay there again. All depends on your level of expectations, if they are low to average, you should be fine, if high, go somewhere else. Get what you pay for.	2.0
Comfortable room in a great town. Nothing fancy, just right for a stop on a road trip. Rob gave us great desk service and local advice. Rooms face the sunrise with was lovely. Guide books in the room were a nice touch and we found some great slot canyons from these. Made our trip even better.	5.0

I looked around quite a bit for a decent pet-friendly hotel, and this fit the bill nicely. Everyone is very nice and friendly. The hotel itself is very comfortable and nicely appointed. If you like modern hip vibe design, this is a good place to be. It's close to restaurants and the Japanese Friends Garden, a very large park next door (though not sure why they call it Japanese since nothing about it is Japanese). I only had drinks at the bar and chose to eat across the street at the Moroccan restaurant. The bartender was very knowledgeable and friendly. The only drawback about this hotel is the lack of sound proofing. My last morning (Saturday), I was woken very early by the person in the room next door with their music blaring. Also, the music from the bar is very, very loud, and there were several people hanging outside the lobby in front of their car with their music turned up so loud it was shaking the windows. My poor dog was so scared. Also, I was gone all day the first full day there, and came back at 830pm to find my room still had not been cleaned. Minor inconvenience.Hi! Thank you for taking the time to write a review! Glad to hear you and your pup had a comfortable stay. There are actually two parks next to us, and you were most likely in Hance Park, not the Japanese Friendship Garden as there is a fee and the grounds there are built and landscaped just as they are in Japan. Perhaps on your next stay we can get you pointed in the right direction. As far as the noise issues you experienced, we are already looking in to ways we can improve this. We apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused for you and your dog. We will also address the issue with your room to see why it hadn't been cleaned while you were away. Again, thanks for this review and we will use it to improve and hopefully see you again in the future.	4.0

I recently stayed at the Hampton Inn Suites in Dodge City on my way to and from a training in KS. When I checked in on Sunday night, Paul greeted me and made sure I had a quiet room on the top floor. It was during a heat wave, and the bottle of water he offered was much appreciated.... More	5.0
We stayed here for 3 nights as part of a road trip! The reception staff were lovely and polite on check in! The rooms were comfortable, clean and very funky! The bathroom was amazing! However the toiletries were not replaced when the room was serviced daily. The walls were quite thin and we could hear the guy in the room next door! It wasnt horrendous and it didnt disturb us. It seemed to be very stylish but some of the finer points were missed. The upstairs bar was recommended to us on check in so we tried it out. We were really disappointed with the bar, it was a Monday night, and it was not busy. The staff seemed uninterested in us, we sat down and my dad went to the bar to ask a couple of questions, he was stood there for nearly 10 minutes, we decided to leave when eventually a member of staff spoke with him so we decided to stay. The first drink I wanted was a southern comfort, but they had none. Next I wanted a Gin and tonic but they had no tonic. In the end I had a cider which wasnt very nice. The bar staff continued to seem disinterested in us and we felt like a burden to them. It was nice sitting on the roof top and having a drink but that was the only bit of the experience we enjoyed. We did not use their car park because it was expensive, but it was in a good location for other car parks. We did not want to be in the middle of the French quarter and found that we enjoyed the 20 minute walk to get there from the hotel! It is in a good location for lots of breakfast stops as well. Hello Leah,Thank you for your stay with us. We are pleased to hear that your check in experience went well but we are sorry to hear there were some issues with housekeeping and the service you received at our roof top bar. These issues have been addressed with the team so that we may improve on this. We hope you will give us a chance to win you back as a guest.	4.0

I was pleasantly surprised. Stayed 7 nights. Staff was friendly and accommodating. I wish I had gotten their names to send them a commendation. The unit was clean and well supplied.

We stayed at a Comfort Inn Suite in AR and was so impressed there that we booked at the Comfort Inn here. This one had also been renovated but didn't have the same pizzaz of the other one. The bathroom was very nice as well as a comfy bed but had a sloppy paint job. In hopes of grabbing... More	4.0
We were very surprised at how the place had been updated. The service was very efficient and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable - the bed itself could have been better, but then the rates would probably been higher. The neighborhood was not the best and there were very few places to eat or pick up needed food or sundries. They are a pet friendly chain, which we liked if we choose to travel with our in the future. All in all, we liked the Red Roof and found it to be better than we expected.	4.0
This was a business trip and I found the hotel occupied by business people as well as families. Staff was very friendly and accommodating, on all shifts. Bed was comfortable. My room was taken care of nicely except for one day when the bed was not made (I didn't mention it to the desk clerk). Breakfast was set up late every day (after 7 a.m. although the sign says 7:00 and I was told it is actually 6 to 6:30 and all the hot items required microwaving, so early birds can't really eat and run. It was impossible to control the heat, cool and humidity in the room but I understand a renovation is scheduled so I imagine that will correct that situation. Price was right. Overall, I would stay in this property again.	4.0
The check-out took too long.	5.0
We had a great stay at The Foundre while in town for a concert. Everything about this hotel was hip right down to the buttons in the elevators. The art was awesome...the Burt Reynolds painting still continues to make me laugh. Be sure to check out the artwork of Phoenix made out of recycled security envelopes and checks...so cool! The room had an industrial-style and were uber-clean. Beds were comfy. Located right next to the lightrail it is an easy ride to the center of downtown Phoenix. Oh and the staff was friendly and helpful!Wow! Thank you so much for this awesome review! We're so happy to hear you had a great stay and loved the hotel. Hope you will visit again soon.	5.0
We checked into this hotel and I was so surprised how much it has changed. We had stayed here several times when it was a Day's Inn. The room smelled so bad it would make you sick to your stomach.

Side door onto Duval St. Perfect location. Rooms may be smaller than anticipated for US guests but standard for Europe. Poolside is great, excellent bar. Didn't eat so cannot comment on food. One big let down was housekeeping. Very poor for this level of property. GM knows who I am and they had plenty opportunity to fix it, but never came back. Overall still pleased. But fix room cleanliness and you then merit Marriott Autograph Collection...Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are pleased to hear that you ended up enjoying your stay but would have loved for you to have a perfect stay. We are taking action to prevent the issues you experienced from occurring again.

The Best Western Inn at the Vines is conveniently located to the main entrance of the Napa Valley right near across the street walking distance to multiple places for shopping, entertainment, gas and dining. I had an easy relaxing time at this Hotel. The hotel staff were friendly informative and always helpful with my questions. The room was modern, clean and quiet. There was also a restaurant on site with a discount for hotel guests. I really enjoyed my stay and plan to return on my next trip to the Napa Valley.Shawn R - Thank you for your kind review.

I believe in the saying you get what you pay for. So, when I came across this hotel (being on a tight budget due to a unplanned 10 hr trip from TX) I booked it and hoped for the best.

Bad: Breakfast a bit simple, but plenty of places to eat in the local area. Also, the safe in our room didn't seem to work, but it wasn't a big deal. Good: Excellent location, with Copley T (metro) station within a few minutes walk, and a range of restaurants and bars along Boylston Street. The Back Bay area also has a few great sights to see, like the old Trinity Church and Boston public library, which are almost within spitting distance of the hotel. If you're here during the Boston Marathon (mid April), the hotel is almost literally on the finishing line, which could be very useful or very inconvenient, depending on whether you're a runner or not!	5.0

I found the hotel very nice. The rooms were clean, the hallways were clean and there was not a lot of noise. The beach is 'yucky', but the pool, the gym and the jacuzzi were very nice. If you eat at the TradeWinds restaurant, don't order the crab cakes. I'm still trying to decide what they tasted like. It certainly was not like a crab cake. Unfortunately, the hotel lost a customer for meals for the next 3 days, as we did not want to chance another food diaster.	3.0
Just feels old. The parking deck is awful if you drive a truck that is equipped with a taller lift than standard. Check in and Check out is a little crazy and long lined but the rooms are nice and clean. Food is good... little cafe has many options.	4.0

The hotel advertises a free breakfast but I went down to the breakfast area at 9:00 a.m. and everything was gone except for boxes of cereal and some not-very-nice looking fruit. The food area was also a mess. The rooms are not in very good repair - some mold damage along the ceiling in both the bedroom and bathroom. They have changed to cotton bed covers that can be washed rather than polyester so that's an improvement. Overall this hotel is fair.	3.0

I was there to visit my daughter and her family, that live in Porstmouth, VA. The hotel is very close to them. I was able to bring my dog. The hotel staff allowed me to leave and leave my dog loose in the room, which was AWESOME! They even assured me that if he got loud, they would just call me. The room was a studio..plenty of room for us both. The hotel was refurbished a year ago. They offer breakfast each morning, waffles, fruit, cereal, etc. They even have snacks, drinks, for sale. Plus anything you might have forgotten! Love this place! I will go back regularly!	5.0

Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights for a family trip. Good stay, breakfast wasn't great, pool needs a major cleaning room was really muggy, there was construction everywhere around that area but we were able to get around fine.

Bad: This place wasn't just right for me: Booked a room with partial sea view - got one on the second floor which was blocked by a palm tree, staff was ok but tended to be on the arrogant side.

Don't believe the negative reviews we stayed at this hotel for four nights and looked forward to coming home each night. My girlfriend used to work at a hotel and she thought the room was typical of hotels costing 50 more a night. Clean room, comfy bed, nice bathroom, friendly staff and free shuttle to the metro, which is half a mile away (takes about 20 mins to ride to Capitol). We heard sounds from neighboring rooms only once, and the noise was faint. Only complaint was the room service - it took 75 minutes to arrive but they gave it to us free. Reading other reviews, we were a little worried about the neighborhood. Don't be. Yes, it's not the best part of town but those who call it a ghetto are way off. We walked to the metro once (and back at night) and we always felt safe. This is a great way to see DC and not spend a ton at a downtown hotel.	5.0
Older dated cheap motel: that was clean, with one of the two best beds in a 2 week trip ! For this class of motel, it is well worth a 5 star rating... better than a lot of motels that cost twice a much or more. Few defects in the tile work in the (dated) bathroom. Will return here any... More	5.0
Hampton Inn is the best hotel we've ever visited. The beds are so comfortable. The complimentary breakfast is delicious (and includes protein foods).

We were there for only two nights, but we were extremely pleased. The meeting halls for our conference were great, our room was wonderfully comfortable, clean, and well-furnished, and most importantly the hospitality and courtesy shown to us as guests tops that of any other hotel we've ever stayed at. This hotel is right at a metro station for two lines that go straight into the downtown area, and is only 3 minutes from the airport. It's also connected to a wonderful mall. In all, the only word to describe the experience is, well, perfect!	5.0

I stayed here for one night. I was not able to check in right at 3 pm so I had to leave and come back. The young lady at the front desk was pleasant enough. The room was decent, although the bath towels smelled like cigarette smoke. I did see the cleaning staff outside the rooms with their carts smoking cigarettes. At times some of the guest were a bit loud and you could here them, but it didn't bother me enough to complain. The location was good for where I needed to go. Ok place to stay for a night OR 2 but I wouldnt do more than that.	2.0

Hotel lobby and common areas looked like they had not been vacumed in days. Room was a little better but found pieces of candy on the floor. The cooked portion of the breakfast looked too cold and rubbery. Could not bring myself to try it. The neighborhood was OK but views were looking directly into mid-rise apartment units. When we checked in the young lady manning the registation desk looked and sounded like she had the flu. No one else was there to help.	3.0
We got an awesome price for our room. When we arrived the staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room is spacious, clean, and has everything you could possibly need. The pools are great and your so close to the beach.	5.0

Since I rarely have or take the time to reply to emails asking me to rate a particular hotel, item or service me seeking out your website to make my comments is telling in itself. My wife and I stayed in the Pentagon City location from 7/4/2013 to 7/7/2013. It was, in our opinion, the best hotel stay for us, ever. Every single member of the staff that we encountered from the moment that we pulled our vehicle into the check in area on 7/4 until our trunk was packed on 7/7 was friendly, professional and helpful. It was our pleasure to enjoy dinner in your restaurant on 7/4 and breakfast the remaining three days. Each meal was excellent. I would specifically like to mention Bryan Haley who took the time on the evening of 7/4 to chat with us at our dinner table. What is amazing to me is that Bryan and most of the other staff seemed to remember us and all of the other guests. Please thank your staff for a memorable stay. I would hope to stay at your hotel the next time we have the opportunity to be in the Washington, D.C. Area.	5.0

This property does not look bad from out front, but room 118 is the worst I have ever seen anywhere. The dead bolt would not lock. The door chain was not secure. The bathroom door was rotten and could not close. A large hole in the wall beside the bathtub where perhaps a soap dish was supposed to be was... More	1.0
This property was delightful in every way -- the perfect place to celebrate my birthday! The decor was unique and our rooms were very comfortable, functional and stylish,. The pool view afforded us a surprisingly quiet stay, particularly given the proximity to Duval Street. Paul and Tripp at the bar were both amazing, each in his own way. They are artists behind the bar, brewing (literally sometimes) concoctions that are different from anything I've ever tasted, but each was really special. And what can I say about Andrew in the kitchen He cooked our tuna and snapper catch in 3 courses, and they were nothing short of magnificent. Again, like nothing I've ever had before. I LOVE this place, and will undoubtedly be back again, hopefully before too long!Thank you so much for your review, we are so delighted your birthday was a success. It tickles me to hear all the great evaluations you have for our staff. I must mention Andrew has this unequivocal desire to please, he lives to see peoples expressions after their first bite. Its good to know we've made a new friend, hope to see you again soon.	5.0
My stay was very short with actually only being a night sleep and catch an early flight however the room was clean and comfortable, the staff were friendly and helpful.	5.0

I always try to stay at the Hyatt House whenever I'm in Seattle for business. The rooms are studio apartments and extremely well kept and clean. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful. The bar / kitchen is open late and the breakfast is pretty good for a free meal. This is not the place for people looking for a luxury experience with a ton of amenities. It's centrally located to Seattle landmarks and if you're lucky you get a view of the Space Needle.Dear JenK Wow! Your header says it all. I am so happy to hear this and that you felt the Hyatt house was exactly what you need. Thank you also for being a repeat guest. Any time we get a 5 star review we celebrate it as a team. I am glad the our larger rooms and knowledgeable staff made your stay great. We hope to see you soon weather it be for business or pleasure! Sincerely,Jonathan	5.0

Wi-fi was hit or miss, breakfast was not good.	3.0
Bad: Parking was very pricey. No discount for staying at the hotel. Walking too far away at night is very uncomfortable but during day it is great fun.. Good: Bed was high -had to climb up- but very comfortable with great fluffy pillows and linens! Japanese toilet seats! Able to adjust room climate. Convenient to Japanese stores and museum. Great area restaurants. Nice caf shop on the ground floor.	5.0

We are laying down for our third and final night here in Room 11. These are the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in! The room is clean, AC is good and chilly, and the deep soaker tub is heaven!

Bad: The street noise was pretty bad. Honking horns til all hours. Hard to sleep. Good: Loved the continental breakfast on every floor so you didn't have to go far. The staff was great and it was a great location.	5.0
Bad: dated, needs face lift and upgrades, rusted and moldy areas inside room, stains on ceilings and closet doors, shower head leaking, sink cracked, small TV for room size, room phone old and crackling when trying to use, food buffet cold and stale - potatoes hard and egg omelettes rubbery, pool small, exercise room even smaller, can't control non-stop planes taking off but would be nice to inform the guests in advance - very loud and ear piercing - constant for hours and hours.... Good: convenient location and breathtaking views, fair price for location, decent parking, coffee and ice water 24-7!	3.0

Tried out Aloft for the ADA rooms. Pleasantly surprised spacious rooms updated features. We will look for the brand in our travels. The receptionist was very friendly and knowledgeable of the area.

The girlfriend and I decided to take a trip to Salem mass for Halloween and upon checking Expedia found this hotel listed as 103 for 2 nights with only 1 room left available. Shocked at this amazing deal we booked immediately. When we arrived and tried to check in we were informed that we owed 230. I was outraged and demanded to talk to a manager who wasn't there. We ended up settling to stay only 1 night which was over 100 and then make our way to Salem the next morning after having breakfast and find somewhere else. We wake up the next morning to find out there isn't even a free breakfast! Very unhappy with this stay and will never go to this hotel or the franchise again!!!!	1.0
Good price for location - a Midway airport hotel. At about 3 miles distant, it's about 1 mile farther out than the main 'hotel row' but still close to all the amenities - restauarants, grocery stores, etc.The hotel was showing its age a little but was comfortable, quiet and adequate. No complaints. Nothng to write home about either.	3.0

Starting with the location - excellent. Perfect to explore the downtown area on foot, many attractions within walking distance or the free shuttle will take you.The room was spacious, clean and very comfortable. We loved having a small kitchen, we loved everything about the room.We were helped by Behder at the front desk who answered all out questions and made us feel very welcome.Any time we return to Seattle, there will be no other option for us than the Hyatt House.	5.0
This was a convenient place to stay and then ride the Metro (only 1 mile walk) into DC to see the sights. The quality and value of the hotel were outstanding. I loved having a suite, it made us feel at home. The housekeeping staff was awesome. I called and requested extra towels and coffee and they brought them within 5 minutes.	5.0

We recently spent two nights at the Inn of the Vines Best Western Plus. The rooms were spacious, clean, and well appointed. The staff was extremely helpful and welcoming. We had reservations for the Wine Train and the hotel location was ideal- only about 1 1/2 miles away.	5.0
I thought it would be nicer than best western or comfort inn, since it's by Sheraton but it's not. The room size is about the same, I got double beds. There's no free breakfast. There's not much establishment around the area. Better go to downtown San Jose. It's still a nice clean hotel with comfy bed and pillows. I'd still recommend it because it's affordable. Maybe I expected too much.	3.0

Although the hotel was close to MDW, the hotel was pretty old. The carpet in our room was pretty bad, it was sticky and needed immediate replacement. The furniture had seen better days. I didn't think it was worth the money we paid. The hotel certainly needs TLC in many areas to keep it competitive. They were charging 8.50 for breakfast. They could have included that in the price we paid for the room. That is not a big deal but the carpet is. The noise level was also high as it is right next to the main thoroughfare.	2.0

I was lead to believe through your site that pets were welcome and no extra fee was charged, then when I got there they told me I had to pay x-amount a day but since the only person staying the next night was my grandmother and I would be leaving with my cat that was all I would be charged but then I was charged 2x more and they said there was nothing they could do about this. I even confronted the same person and asked why I was paying 2x more and that this was not what you told me the day before, he said he was sorry, but I was to pay 2x more. I will never go to Days Inn again, x amount a day is ridiculous.	1.0

This hotel is in a great location - walking distance to many fantastic restaurants, Powell's Bookstore, Pioneer Square, and the Brewery District. The staff are great, welcoming and friendly and always helpful with directions and restaurant recommendation.... More	5.0

We decided to go to Charleston for Thanksgiving weekend and had an enjoyable experience. Great location within an easy walk to all of the attractions. The rooms are super clean and comfortable and the courtyard is well maintained. The free breakfast in the morning followed by the wine and cheese pairings every evening make this a must stay when in... More	5.0
The hotel is well maintained and kept clean. The rooms are tastefully decorated and very clean. All the staff I interacted with were very friendly and courteous. The continental breakfast is what you would expect at most hotels. Biggest disappointment was the reliability of the shuttle. One reason for choosing this hotel was the shuttle, and I was only able... More	4.0
As with many of my other reviews my love of the best western chain was once again confirmed with this property. The staff was welcoming and friendly, and the property and rooms were very clean throughout. These things make a huge difference anytime you travel but especially when you travel for weeks at a time. This Hotel and it's staff... More	5.0
The only complaint that I have was that you couldn't close the thicker curtain so no light came through .. We had a post light from outside shine through our window all night making it hard to sleep	4.0
Bad: At breakfast, could not keep up with demand.	3.0
This was a planned getaway for 3 sisters celebrating special birthdays. Everything was above and beyond our expectations! We felt like the Innkeepers had thought of everything! We stayed in the Refugio suite which was more than we could have asked for. Lots of room with a beautiful outdoor sitting area overlooking back gardens. A welcoming box of truffles, ... More	5.0

Great downtown location with easy access to local businesses and downtown historical points. Friendly staff with no frills comfortable accommodations at a fair price. Within walking distance to downtown tourist attractions. Easy to get to.	3.0
Brilliant design, great and thoughtful creative art. Service was the same. Creative bar menu, knowledgeable bartenders, especially Maxwell. Room- well designed, interesting design with iron industrial structures. Bathroom with double sided sink, large walk in shower is great. Loved the Bass Egg Bluetooth speaker was a surprise bonus.

We were smelling cigarette smoke in our room and proceeded to open both windows and the door. It really didn't help so we went into the hall and determined it must be coming from the room across from us and into the vents. We called the desk, they sent a man up, and he said he could not knock on... More	2.0
I expect VERY little from a hotel. I'm cheap by nature, and I really only want a door that locks and a shower that's hot. However, Hotel 502 made me rethink my low expectations and future travel plans. The front desk clerks ARE friendly and responsive, BUT, the rooms are very shabby and barely clean ('down there' hair on toilet seat, permanent mystery stain on sheets), the shower was cold/lukewarm (at best) and the neighborhood is less than desirable--LOTS of transients and sketchy folks wandering on property. I only paid 62 (+tax) per night, but if I had paid more I would have been really angry. As I said earlier, I really only want a locking door and hot shower (for 60+ I don't expect much). I can overlook the worn down rooms (I was told our room was renovated, but my mother stayed here when it was formally the Red Roof Inn, and said it looked the same, save a new t.v., and a different paint color on the bathroom wall). I can overlook the fact that a storm knocked out their WiFi and the pool was closed. I can overlook the people passed out drunk in their cars, and the less than clean room/bath. But NO hot shower Not good--even for 62 and some change. The only plus was the friendly front desk clerk--she gets kudos.	2.0
Bad: The rooms are tiny, but expensive. The staff was not very friendly or helpful. They seemed bored and not so welcoming to visitors. They didnt refill the coffee thermos for breakfast and didnt care to either. It was awkward. Good: The place is clean and centrally located. I enjoyed the music playing in the room upon arrival. Its been updated although its an old building.	3.0
We spent months searching for the perfect place to stay for our 10th anniversary trip to Oahu. After reading several great reviews, we chose Ocean Tower.After having made the reservations on expedia.com, we called the hotel to see if we could reserve a king bed with a balcony. Nothing could be for sure but the nice young man said he would put us down for one.We arrived in Honolulu late, after a long flight. Check in for us was a breeze! In just a minute we had our key cards. We were well pleased with the room. We were able to get the king bed and balcony after all! Upon entering the room, we were greated with a cool clean room. We couldn't have been more pleased with our room. The was even a desk area where we were able to set up our lap top, and a safe, no extra charge.Leonor Wong met us the next morning with a smile and an offer of custard pie and fresh pineapple to share. She was very friendly as we chatted, she asked what we were in Hawaii for. We answered with it being our 10 year anniversary. After some exploring on the island we came back to our room to find champagn chilling in ice with glasses and box of chocolates and a beautiful flowering plant! We were thrilled and touched at the efforts this women and her staff and boss go to for their customers.We did breakfast a few times downstairs in the hotel. It was a nice little set up, with a toaster and bread, peanut butter and jelly. There were also some really delicious muffins and some other types of pasteries. The coffee was wonderful, there was hot tea and also pineapple juice. The lobby area was a great place to sit and sip your coffee and nibble on the yummy muffins.Grace, the front desk girl was very friendly and helpful. I was suprised that as many people they have in and out daily, she remembered my last name and we had not actually met. She was helpful to print out driving directions for us several times and had clean beach towels for us each day when we headed out.The location of the hotel was great.We had an ocean view room even though we didn't pay for one. That was nice.The beach is a 2 minute walk, and the ABC store right next to Ocean Tower. It is within walking distance of many great resturants and shops.Over all, our stay was a wonderful time for us. We had tons of fun all day long and then had a nice cool, clean room to come back to and relax. When it came time for us to check out, Leonor present us with handmade leis she had made for us. We were very touched. Then she handed us a little basket with more chocolates and macadamia nuts! She also sent me away with fresh baked banana bread too! We really felt special. This place is a people friendly place. They treat each guest as though they were the most special. I have never seen this high quality customer service before in my life!If you are looking for a place to stay that is close to the beach, this is it. This is the place to stay no matter what. I do know they are upgrading their rooms and we were able to see 2 of these finished rooms. Wow.This hotel is probably going to go up to a 4 star rating.When we return to Oahu oneday we will be staying with Ocean Tower. These are some special people and they are doing it right!	5.0
Room smelled of stale smoke. Furniture broken and dirty.	2.0
Very comfortable and plush accommodations at a reasonable price right off Foothills Blvd. Beds were especially comfortable. Breakfast was a little disappointing but varied enough that there was something for everyone	4.0
We spent two relaxing nights at the Omni. Wonderful room, helpful staff. Rooftop pool and bar was terrific, a great place to view the City and River during the day or night. We didn'the try the hotel restaurant, since we were tempted by the aromas of other restaurants while walking the French Quarter.	5.0
Awesome service! Tidy! Hygenic Clean!Provide beach towels for free. Great advice for restaurants from the front desk. Easy to use washing machines and dryers (2 of each). Complimentary coffee, water toiletries. Breakfast is nice and light. Perfect for on the go. We had room 404 facing the canal. I would definitely recommend asking for a room higher (5+)... More	5.0

My family loved this hotel. Good continental breakfast and free dinner on weekdays. Kids enjoyed the indoor pool. Room is large , clean and has central air instead of those loud a/c units. The only negative for me was that the bed was too hard.	5.0
Stay in Pittsburgh was great. The location was very close to all the places we wanted to go. Room was perfect. Pool was a little small. Breakfast was ok I do not think the staff could keep up with the rush in the morning.	5.0
We arrived and the helpful staff got us an early check in which was much appreciated, our room was a pet friendly room so hardwood floors which was a bit cold and didn't give a cozy feel, I understand as it's practical for pets. The room was small and felt like it needed updating, the outlets were faulty as plugs... More	3.0
This place is ideally located with theaters, supermarkets, fast food, fine restaurants, all near by. The architecture is really beautiful and it is brand new. It provides easy access to downtown Napa as well as to the main highway north to all the wineries. My room was on the ground floor, No. 130 and there was some noise from upstairs translated below but not bad. Also had really nice, big screen, TVs.Dear TSCClovisCa,Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. I appreciate your awesome feedback, compliments of our hotel's location and arthitectural features. Thank you again for staying with the Hampton Inn SUites Napa, we hope to serve you again in the near future.	5.0

Hotel was fine, big room, great view...but having to pay for WiFi, after paying so much for a room, as well as free WiFi for non-residents in the lobby? Over priced restaurant and bar, the top view is only for VIP guests, loads of people attending a conference over everywhere.....wouldn't stay here again. Disappointed after paying so much money then being asked to pay more for the basics...especially with the more attractive alternatives nearby.	2.0

I travel a lot with my job, so I'm constantly staying at hotels. When my co-workers and I arrived late last night at the Aloft the people at the front desk were more than welcoming.

This Holiday Inn Express was very clean. The beds were super comfortable. The location was right off I-40.

The next morning enjoy a really good cup of coffee.... More	5.0
We enjoyed the food very much and our server was great. Lasagne was special. No push to order wine. We had enough earlier. Nice atmosphere.	4.0
Basic room. Staff was nice and helpful. No lock on bathroom door. No hair dryer. Mini fridge in room clicked loudly and had to unplug to sleep. Denny's in parking lot which I originally counted as a plus attracted people leaving clubs at 2 am making the parking lot very noisy on Saturday night. AC worked well.	3.0
Very disappointed. First of all, I felt taken advantage of. There are few choices in this town and the management knows it. I needed a government rate--you know the rate offered in every other city in the US. Not here. I booked early and still had to pay 40 out of pocket for my stay over and above my allotment... More	1.0
We booked at Grand prix Motel last minute for Jeep week 2016. I was a little skeptical due to the stories you hear about outdated motels and the few bad reviews.

Well, there's lots of things I could say about this nice, modern hotel right across the street from the aquarium, Centennial Olympic Park and numerous restaurants.

We were in Key West September 18th thru September 22nd. We were supposed to meet another couple but unfortunately they couldn't make it because Anne- Marie broke her ankle shortly before the trip. So, we got to the Saint Hotel that Sunday after being dropped off by a taxi that we took from the airport. I would have never believed that something so beautiful would be behind the front doors that we entered. Once inside,the place was magnificent! The room, the pool, the bar/restaurant area were all so nice! I would be remiss if I did not mention how friendly and personable the staff was, particularly Gustavo Lobo and Maria. Gustavo was so helpful and friendly. He was so pleasant to be around. He went out of his way to help us, especially when we were at the pool. And Maria, she was so personable and a pleasure to talk to. Both were outstanding people! Wish we could have stayed longer! We mistakenly left a bag of gifts at the hotel when we had already left for home and after calling the hotel to see if we had left it there, it was sent back to our home within five days! Great place, both hotel and island!!!!!!!!!Thank your for this amazing review.Please be sure that I will share this comment with Gustavo Maria. They make us proud everyday by providing a genuinely caring service to our guests.In addition, we are flatted that you truly appreciate the unique decor and saintly vibe of our establishment. And it is true that the Saint is full of surprises and mystery...On the other hand, I am sorry to hear that your trip with us was too short, but note that we will always be pleased to have you here in Key West.	5.0

The hotel was a pleasant surprise. Perfectly located in the French Quarter and 1 block from Bourbon Street. I stayed in a petite room - but was impressed by the updated and clean rooms/bathrooms.

Previous reviewers have nailed it....nice property, good location, attractive but crowded pool with tons of kids. We did swim at the beach right by the resort but there's not really a big enough flat area to set up/relax there. Rented via vrbo and got a decent price.

I was not expecting a room with outside access. I would not have stayed there if I had know what to expect. The description listed the room as not ocean front. It should have stated it was in a separate building and that it was motel style. Air conditioner was located directly below the thermostat and there was one air conditioner and thermostat for both rooms sections in the suite. Could not maintain a comfortable temperature.	2.0
I got to Oceanside a day early without reservations. Driving down Coast Highway I saw a Motel 6 which I thought was closed for renovations. On second look I saw half of it was open, so I checked in.

wonderful place, refrigerator, microwave and safe in our room--clean and pleasant staff. wonderful breakfast with two choices of pancakes you could make--very helpful in the breakfast area and with information about the area staying closer to Bardstown would have been nicer	5.0
For the price it was exactly what I expected. Friendly staff, clean rooms, a little weak on the breakfast options.	4.0
We were passing through. After searching trip advisor reviews we chose this hotel because it is pet friendly and we had our tiny dog. The bed was comfy and room reasonably clean.

Stayed hare for a night as all else was full. Staff was friendly and easy check in. Breakfast was very disappointing. Little choice and not fresh. The room to the front was noisy and not clean. Bath room was part of room which made the room damp! Wifi and access to highway easy. Parking ok.	2.0
Great place to stay for reasonable price near Northpoint Mall. Very clean, moderate-sized, 6 foot something deep, indoor pool, and small hot tub. Staff VERY friendly and helpful! Good food at free Cont breakfast. Waffle House right across the parking lot if you are a late sleeper!	5.0

I really do love staying at Aria!

This is a really nice, smallish resort right on the lake. It is geared towards families with smaller children. They do allow pets, so there were quite a few dogs there.

We stay at this property at least once a year when we head to Vegas to visit family. We like the location, off the strip in more of the residential area. The rooms have recently been renovated with an updated dcor. The rooms are very spacious and we have never had a problem with noise. The pool never seems crowded. The food is average. Sunrise breakfast for 3.99 in the caf, but you have to know about it as it is not on the menu. We are members of their BConnected players program and do receive the occasional perk, however be aware that anything you win ie. breakfast buffets, have to be used the following day. Other casinos vouchers are good for a longer period of time. Years ago I used to win money or break even, not so for the past few years. We had an issue with our bill at check-out, as we do every year. Someone had visited a bar and charged it to our room. The front desk gal said she'd look into it and within an hour was corrected. My only negative comment is how unwilling they are to satisfy a customer issue. Tried to use buffet coupons one day after expiration. We were told to go to the players club and see about getting comps...were told NO. We had a 15.00 food credit on the room which apparently was only good for that particular date (we used it the day before) and upon check-out was charged to the room. I explained that we were not told it could only be used for that particular date as our stay was for more that one day. NO credit. Very poor customer service considering the size of Boyd properties. Pretty sure 15.00 isn't going to break them and I don't like feeling cheated. This will definitely be a deciding factor for our next trip. Plenty of places to choose from when visiting Las Vegas. Suncoast isn't the only game in town!	3.0

Our dance group stays at this hotel every year when we are having a weekend festival in Burnet. This hotel is the choice of the group and we are totally satisfied with the hotel and the staff. They treat us like royalty and we love it.	5.0
Bad: The only disadvantage is lack of elevator, however it's quite common in Ar Deco hotels. However you could ask for ground floor room. Good: I loved staying there. The hotel located between 4th and 3d streets. It's quiet part of seashore, there was much less noise than at Ocean drive. 5-7 min to the beach. Good wi-fi. Reasoable breakfast with cereals and cookies.	4.0
Bad: Worst bartender ever. Long Island Iced Tea missing a few ingredients, King Alphonse was actually a Kahlua and cream with ice. Ugh. In-room coffee machine didn't work, took two days to get fixed, and then made awful coffee. Morning coffee from the restaurant was undrinkable. Thankfully, Starbucks nearby. Good: Best restaurant for dinner of any hotel anywhere. Entrees superb, bread pudding beyond superb. Excellent security staff -- Cheerfully and efficiently retrieved my forgotten keyboard, assured me it was safe, and FedExed it to me no charge. Decor stylish, cozy room made clever use of small space, room clean, rain shower nice. Non-convention type hotel very appealing. Really great value in accessible walkable location.	5.0

This a super nice Hampton. The desk staff is friendly, the breakfast was delicious. Our room was spotless. The beds are super comfortable. We had a river view room with a balcony. It was nice to be able to relax on the balcony.We had an issue with the thermostat and maintenance came up promptly--turns out it was operator error! Asked for extra towels one evening and they were brought up immediately. On Tuesdays and Saturdays there is a nice Farmer's Market just a few yards away (I believe it closes in October until next season). A grocery store within walking distance. We definitely recommend!Dear PeggyS513,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We appreciate your valuable feedback, as well all the great things you mentioned about our friendly staff and comfortable beds. Our balcony rooms do have a different thermostat unit than the others and typically we do get calls about them not operating. Unfortunately you do need to be within so many feet of the unit for it to operate properly and this typically take care of the issue. The farmer's market is definitely coming to an end, I would anticipate it to end come November. We're glad to hear that you recommend us and we hope to see you on your next trip to Napa Valley. Thank you, Serina Najar.	5.0
I really like the trip to Hawaii, and I think that everybody in the hotel was really nice to us in every think, the rooms were really clean, the breakfast were good too, and all the people help me when I had a question. I would come to the same hotel if I'll return to Hawaii. It was a really good experience.Ana	4.0
I've stayed at several Marriott's especially in the Houston area. This experience has been one of the best. Check was quick smooth. The staff was pleasant and efficient. The only downside is that although the location is perfect for getting downtown and only 5 minutes from the Galleria, the hotel can be difficult to get to if you're not... More	4.0
Would be a 4 but the elevators are terrible. You have to wait forever. You even take escalators down to lower levels to get enough space to ride the elevators up. Other than that a nice hotel. Pretty river view from some rooms kind of makes up for it.	3.0
The London is my favorite West Hollywood Hotel. It's private (just off the Sunset Strip). It's high class elegance and sophistication with a nice dose of hip. The staff is amazing. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. The pool deck has an amazing view of Weho and is amazing people watching, all the hip and glamour people are here!	5.0
We originally was staying at Super 8. But that hotel was very disgusting. So we stayed at Courtyard by Marriott. Very clean friendly. Will surely stay again highly recommend it to family friends.	5.0
Located right across the street from the Space Needle. The complementary breakfast buffet was excellent and much better than the Residence Inn hotels. There are several restaurants within walking distance for dinner. For the more economical meals, there is also a McDonalds across the street from the hotel. The Duck Boat tours also start from next to McDonalds.The rooms are of decent size and comfortable. They also have a complementary shuttle to the Pier 66 from where NCL ship departed. Will highly recommend it to people and will be my personal choice of stay in Seattle in future as well. The front desk staff is exceptionally polite and helpful (particularly Nate), and so are the shuttle bus drivers. Prices for the hotel are on the high end side, but so are most of the Seattle downtown hotels.ChandraHSGBI,We are thrilled to hear the Hyatt House met your needs and appreciate the positive feedback. Im glad you were able to take advantage of our 24 hour shuttle and the complimentary breakfast spread in the morning. Its wonderful to know when guests have a comfortable stay as we are grateful of the comments. We look forward to your next visit in Seattle!Sarah Junge	5.0
I chose this Microtel because I had stayed here before about eight years ago and it was very nice. At the time it typified a Microtel - clean, efficient, comfortable, modern. This particular Microtel has gone downhill. The wall above the closet was damaged, the tub was worn, and the plumbing under the sink was disgustingly filthy. There are a number of lodging options within a block the next time I need to stay in this area I will use one of them.	3.0
I stayed here for a few days. The staff is very attentive, and keeps the building in great shape. The rooms and property are well kept. The breakfast is kept stocked up.and they provide sack breakfast if you have to eat on the run. My only complaint would be on the location of the coffee pot. It is in the... More	4.0

Great vision combined with high energy ,pushing hospitality into a my first stay in this aloft brand . Rates were reasonable. Location was great. Clean room. Large shower . Comfortable bed.

This must be the only hotel in America that doesn't have a complimentary breakfast. 30 for a couple of cups of coffee and four boxes of cereal, milk, and bananas.

This is a nice family owned hotel. It is well appointed but not luxury. The service was exceptional. They could teach a course in hotel service. The staff introduced themselves and remembered our name.	5.0
The reception desk guy at checkin was reckless. The breakfast is extremely poor (some apples, cakes and coffee) uncomfortably served in every corridor of each floor of the hotel. Comfort is absent, there is no soundproofing in the rooms facing the street, nor in the back. The use of ear plugs is mandatory and probably insufficient to reduce continuous noise (day and night) from heavy duty air conditioning equipment of many commercial buildings surrounding the hotel. The Hotel offers extremely poor value for money. It is not a four (4) stars at all. Staying there was hard and exhausting. AVOID IT. Suitable cleanliness and location.	2.0
Found The Press Hotel when searching Trip Advisor and we were thankful. What a nice surprise finding this architectural gem. We were looking for a property centrally located with amenities.

We really enjoyed our time at the Mills House. We were impressed when walking in and seeing the elegant chandeliers, marble flooring and elegant decor. The rooms were also decorated nicely and the bed comfortable. My only complaint would be that the walls are thin and you can hear your neighbors watching tv and talking. The location is great - close to many shops and restaurants and a quick walk down to Waterfront Park and other attractions.	4.0
We stayed for 3 days over the Memorial Day weekend 2015. This was a good hotel. Great location and very convenient to the Metro train. They have a REAL, full breakfast selection which was great..! We would definitely stay there again in a heartbeat.	5.0

The staff are not only well trained, they are well hired. In other words, the people the employees are a match for the Drury brand, as their personalities are what I want to see in a hotel.

Very disappointed in cleanliness of the room and daily cleaning. Greeted by indifferent desk clerks...not close to good restaurants. The renovation which has apparently been going on for a long time meant there was clutter in the entrance and hallways.	2.0

I have stayed at the Holiday Inn Twice! Both times we had problems with the rooms. The first time it was the room that was dirty (used condoms on the floor, found by my grandchildren) they did not come in to clean the room until 10:30pm.On July 3,2011 I also reserved 2 adjoining rooms. The outside of the Hotel was a mess. The plants and trees were all dead. The inside was being remolded and was okay. They workers kept it nice and clean. The girls at the front desk did not seem to know what they were doing! It took two of them to figure where we were supposed to stay and how to charge us. I ended up getting overcharged for the rooms and to make matters worse I was double charged. When I called them, I left a message for the someone to call me back. They said it would be in a half hour. Well one and a half hours later I had to call. They would not put me through to the manager. They even hung up on me. Mind you I was not that upset at that time. I just wwanted to get someone to take care of the problem without me having to tell 5 people. Give me the right one the first time. I finally got the desk manager and she wanted to call me back, I told her no I would not take that chance. She said she would look it up and call me back. Now I am waiting for her call. Wish me luck!Now mind you the hotel was being remodeled and that was fine. But the pool area was dirty! There were glasses on all of the tables and towels laying around. (actually we should pick up after ourselfs). the water was not clean and not clear. We did take our towels out of the rooms with us and took them back in. We asked the desk for clean ones and we got them right away brought to our room. It was 1:p.m. when we were in the pool. this Holiday Inn is the olny hotel close to my brothers house. But believe me next time will stay somewhere esle. I might have to drive further but maybe I will have a better stay!	1.0

The picture on their web site is correct but everything else is garbage. The bathroom had what looked like blood on the curtains. There was people outside drinking alcohol and being loud despite the 40 degree weather with rain. The stairway up to the 3rd floor smelled like urine. Strongly recommend to pay the extra money and stay at a different hotel. Would not take family here.	1.0

I have never written a review, good or bad, but the experience at Hampton from their staff especially Kalah was so atrocious that I felt the need to prewarn people about this particular employee who was rude, unprofessional and argumentative and when I called to inform the manager of the experience, I received no calls back. The hotel overbooks and apparently doesn't care.Dear Cinandyoung,Thank you for taking the time to express yourself about your experience with the Hampton Inn Suites. As we always try to do our best given the circumstances and situation at hand. I apologize that we fell short in being able to accommodate you as our guest. I appreciate your feed back and will turn this situation into a learning lesson on how we can handle this situation better next time. I thank you again for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We hope you give us the opportunity to make this stay up on you next trip to Napa Valley.

Bad: To be honest there wasn't anything I did not like which is rare specially with two kids.

Very impressed with this hotel. Great location opposite the Space Needle - and the monorail ran past our windows - no noise at all!So convenient for getting quickly into the centre for all your sight seeing. Rooms are comfortable and clean, with little kitchenette facilities.

The hotel is OK, decent bed but very old decor and cheap, can not find place to put bath amenities, there is one small sink which has no space.

I wanted to surpirse my boyfriend by not having to go home after picking him up from the airport and everything about the hotel was PERFECT. The location and hotel didn't feel like we were in Phoenix, and we live here!We're so happy to hear you had a wonderful time! Please visit again soon.	5.0
The hotel room itself was clean, spacious, and in good repair. We, however, had problems from beginning to end with the booking process. We blocked rooms for an anniversary party. Guests were either told the block was full or didn't exist. My husband and I extended our stay by one day upon check-in. We received 4 phone calls from the front desk by different people asking if we were checking out. Front desk staff was very disorganized and uninformed. I would not recommend this particular hotel.Dear jenniferrB6116DR,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We truly appreciate all your feedback. I will personally be looking into the details of your blocked rooms. We always want to be sure that the entire team is always on the same page and from your comments it looks as if we may have missed a step. I truly apologize for any over site on our end and I will be sure we button up those missed items you mentioned. I thank you again for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa and will be sure to pass along this information to the proper individuals. Best regards, Serina Najar.	3.0

If you are looking for a hotel near the French quarter and want luxury and service - this is the hotel for you. All rooms were clean, a good size and beautiful.The staff were so helpful and we are in the hotel restaurant a couple of times and the food was delicious and very helpful staff.When we come to New Orleans again this hotel is a must for us.SandGT,Thank you for taking time to leave feedback on our hotel! We take pride in giving excellent service for everyone who walks through our hotel, and are happy to hear that you loved your stay with us, as well as the helpfulness of the staff! The Food Beverage team will be thrilled to hear of your love of the food as well! We are lucky to work in a historic property in its prime location, but know that without a consistent level of top notch service our guests would choose one of the many other options nearby. Again, thank you for promoting us on TripAdvisor. We look forward to hosting you during your next stay! Have a wonderful day!	5.0

My daughter and I stay here on our way to California. Our was nice, our room was clean and very pleasant. The location of the hotel was very close to I-10. However as the night progress and more guest arrived, we could hear footsteps above us as the guest walked around. Also we had a non-smoking room, but we could smell cigarette smoke from our restroom.	3.0
2 things are mandatory for a good hotel stay. 1. that the place is clean, and this was. 2. that the bed be comfortable and this WAS NOT!! It was a struggle to not roll into the divot that was in the center of the mattress. Both my husband and I had a terrible nights sleep.	2.0

So if you are going to Chicago to stay in your luxury hotel to be pampered with massages and 5 star room service- this is not your hotel. If you are going to Chicago to shop, sight see, or hit a few wonderful restaurants and want a clean, well maintained hotel where you can sleep peacefully- this is your place. The price is great for what you get. There are few frills, but the accommodations are very reasonable in terms of function and comfort. The perks:- Great location! Close to shopping, parks, restaurants, Navy Pier and most downtown sights.- In and out valet parking for a reasonable Chicago price (52/day). You can find cheaper parking nearby, but not with in and out options.- Complimentary ater bottles and purified water on all floors.-Lounge with complimentary snacks, coffee, tea, and soda open for much of the day.- Wine in the Lobby in the evening.- Responsive, kind staff.-Free high speed internet is high speed enough for most purposes.The less fabulous aspects:-Rooms are small or sparsely decorated. The rooms serve as a clean, functional space. There are no bathtubs, only showers. You get a a couch, TV, mini fridge and desk if you upgrade to a queen suite.-Matrresses are firm...not so firm those of us who prefer softer beds can not sleep, but firm.- Valet was understaffed for our visit with only one attendant even during busier times. It did take 20 minutes to get our car when requested.- The cable is not top quality and goes out or the stream gets paused often.	4.0

Bad: It's not a negative per se but, breakfast could be more widely selective. But what was there was absolutely fantastic. Good: We were super-well accommodated, the staff was super-friendly and helpful. Location is great, and even on a loud street you couldn't here a thing.	5.0
This hotel exceeded all my expectations. It is conveniently located and a short drive to everything San Diego has to offer. Marcia and Elisa at the front desk were incredibly helpful and friendly making my stay all the better. They went out of their way to answer any questions and make recommendations as to what to see. Thanks again!	5.0
Bad: Although this hotel was a pet friendly hotel, guests are not allowed to leave their pets in the room unattended. If I needed to step out quickly, I would have to make other arragements for my pet. I seek out hotels that are strictly pet friendly because I know that a little barking isnt going to be an issue.

Stayed here with a few friends for a weekend getaway. Nice bar/lounge in the lobby area with a decent sized commissary with snacks and drinks for sale. The rooms were nice and new. We watched some of the NCAA games in our room and the tv was a bit smaller than I would like but it was still a good picture. The location is probably the best part. Its about 3 blocks from Bourbon St which means its a short walk but far enough away not to be impacted by the noise. There still is some construction going on and the pool will not be completed until May, but overall, still a very solid stay.It's always great to hear that we have another satisfied guest! It seems to be a consensus that our location is key to having access to all that New Orleans has to offer yet far enough away to relax peacefully. Thanks, Kristi	4.0

After arriving at BWI, I called the hotel for a shuttle. 45 minutes later, I called again. The shuttle had never been dispatched, so I had to wait another 20 minutes before it arrived. No apology was forthcoming. There is no business center at this hotel and the restaurant needs a major upgrade. The room, however, was well maintained and comfortable.	2.0

Good: We liked that breakfast was served until 10am. Traveling with young adults and children, it makes for a hectic morning when we have to get to breakfast by 9am. It was a nice, short walk to the Maryland Science Museum and National Aquarium. We were prepared for below average temperatures, so were able to enjoy our stroll around the harbor. We also appreciated that we were able to keep our vehicle parked at no extra cost for several hours past checkout time.	5.0
Stay away from this place. It is a dirty roach Motel!! It seems like the place is more like low income housing for homeless people and drug users then a hotel for tourists-visitors. The rooms were dirty and smelled. There were people smoking weed and doing drugs in the parking lot. I would not recommend this place to anyone.	1.0
Loved our stay however Elevator was broken and it took forever to catch. Great neighborhood!!!! Stores and restaurants galore!	5.0
Walked in to the room and was greeted by an overpowering stench of disinfectant. We opened all the windows but it took several days for the smell to disappear. Ceilings are extremely thin and so you hear anyone walking around upstairs well into the late hours of the night. Every morning, we found broken glass in the parking lot, probably from a late night patron of the breakfast joint next door. For 240 bucks per night, I would have expected far less problems. I shared these issues with the front desk and they said they would put us in an upstairs room on our next visit. This is obviously an old motel turned into a Best Western. We won't be back.Thank you for completing the survey regarding your recent stay at our property. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future. We have always been a Best Western and have just gone through a 100 remodel of our property I hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience.	2.0

Stayed two nights, was greeted by Ben who was very helpful throughout our meetings during our stay, nicest hotel staff we had on our 2 week trip. The room has been refurbished but it's lacking coffee in the room, it's available by the front desk though. Nothing against the hotel (it's next to a Hilton who would have the same issue) but there are a lot of homeless in the area although they generally didn't cause much issue. It was noted the expensive hotels seem to have walkways above the pavements to avoid the riffraff, although I didn't really like the idea of rising above everyone else to be honest. Only a 5 min walk to Marta stations and downtown areas, 10 mins to the Olympic park area.	4.0
We could not have had a better stay at the Mills House Hotel. Every detail was managed well. Because of our recent bookings at other hotels in this chain, we were automatically upgraded to their priority club. Great amenities came with the upgrade, which made our stay more enjoyable. The entire staff was friendly, courteous, and professional. The front desk and concierge made dinner suggestions and reservations for us both nights, with which we were very satisfied. We could not have stayed in a better hotel. We will stay there again if we return.	5.0

I have to recommend your housekeeping staff. The roof was fit for a king. I am employed in the housekeeping field so my standards in cleanliness and neatness go way beyond and my room was neat clean and very nice. I enjoyed the breakfast the hotel offered in the morning.

I booked this hotel for one night, because I was attending a funeral. The stay was ok. Nothing bad, nothing great. However, they charged my credit card on top of already having paid through Expedia. I called eleven times to get things straightened out and left messages with three different managers. NOBODY will apologize. This was on my check-card, needless to say it messed up my balance and i couldn't even buy gas to get home!!!!!! It was hard enough with a toddler, funeral and now this!!	3.0

Can't beat the walk to the Aquarium, Childrens Museum and Olympic Park (2 good playgrounds for little ones) Valet parking was 32 bucks a night which we thought was a bit steep but it was very busy in the area surrounding the hotel so parking is scarce.

We stayed here before a Saints game with kids. Pros: Location was perfect for this - room was clean and large and the kids loved the games in the bar. The bar staff was particularly helpful and friendly. Cons: the front desk is understaffed and really slow, both check-in and check-out. The breakfast area ran out of almost all items and closed early. The hotel screwed up our pre-arranged late checkout and locked us out, and then gave us the wrong key TWICE. Long story, but the whole mix up ended up costing us 45+ minutes.Well that's certainly not the experience we hope to provide. We will be sure to share your feedback with our front office to ensure this is not an ongoing issue. We do hope you give us another shot next season!

Located in an out-of-the-way setting not far from The Mall, we had high hopes for a good night's sleep since the area was low traffic. Upon arrival we were given a sales pitch for the bar on site (no, we don't want to spend more money, thank you) and then speedily checked in. We did ask about the hours for... More	3.0
I took my son and daughter to Miami Sunny Isles Beach for the Surfers Healing event. This was our very first time in Miami. Being a single mom, I couldn't afford the hotels on the beach and I wanted one with a great pool, at a decent price. I was able to find this one at a GREAT price and it appeared to have a nice pool as well. This hotel was awesome! Friendly staff, very clean room, and the beds were very comfortable as well. I had to use room service once, and they were prompt. Free parking and WIFI as well. The kids LOVED it and said that it was really nice. We would stay again if we ever come back to the area.	5.0
We were very tired when we arrived with a cranky baby. Pierre at the front desk was very helpful and got us in our room quickly. We had some difficulty with the door, the handle had to be pushed up, instead of down, which delayed us getting into the room. The room was clean though somewhat worn/dated (old phones, ceiling in bathroom had areas that needed repair/patched, carpet was threadbare in some areas, etc.). We were thankful that the room was very quiet which help us to get a good few hours of sleep before my daughter and grandson's flight. The shuttle driver that took us to BWI was exceptionally helpful and I was very grateful that he came back to pick me up after seeing my daughter and grandson off.	4.0
I stayed for three days and I quite enjoyed it. It's quite a distance from the Strip but the mellowness and the view from my room was worth it. Although the decor in the rooms were a little outdated, they were very clean and very SPACIOUS! The one thing I liked about the rooms was that it did not have the adjoining locked doors to the next room, so privacy was well in tact. The safe and fridge were also a plus. Adding to the spaciousness, the bathrooms was quite also large. I had two sinks in one area and then the toilet and shower in a separate part of the bathroom separated by a door. I ate at the buffet for the three days I was there. The selection of food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner was the same each day but was worth the price especially if you signed up for the casino card. You can't beat eating at a buffet for 8+ for breakfast and 11+ for dinner. Sorry, I could not remember how much I paid exactly, but know for sure that it was way cheaper to eat there than at one of the buffets at the Strip. I'd definately stay here again!	5.0
Enjoyed the stay. Your crew is excellent, in spite of the power outage. Your Happy Hour is very happy, excellent service. The catering company is doing a very nice job of making everybody happy.

A wonderful place to stay! Very convenient right in town, very friendly staff with a lot of info for the area! Kitchennet is really nice , comfortable beds and nice bathroom, quiet and comfortable.a great price for a great stay	5.0
Bad: The airconditioner in the room did not work, and it made a very loud sound all night. We told the front desk and they were able to fix it for the next night stay. It's understandable because the hotel itself is very old. We would probably stay in a different hotel when we go back. Good: Staff was very helpful and nice. Tony Romo's restaurant was very good.	3.0
We arrived at the Chateau around 11:00 a.m. and they told us to come back at 1:00 for pre-registration. We went back at 1:00 and registered but our room still wasn't ready.

This is a small very clean motel, just what you need to stay for the night without the frills. Steve was helpful, and you can walk to stores and restaurants. There were not many other travelers, so cannot comment on the noise as other reviews mentioned.	5.0
Overall our stay was decent. However, I would've rated it higher if the indoor pool was clean and usable. It was GREEN and smelled unkept which was disappointing with 2 children. In addition, the bathroom could've been cleaner. The toilet bowl was cleaned and the shower curtain was moldy. On a positive note, the staff was EXTREMELY friendly and the complimentary breakfast was quite yummy	3.0

This hotel was a good value. The rooms are clean and comfortable and mine was newly upgraded. The hotel staff was courteous and helpful. The only real issue is the noise...constant hammering that seemed as though it was in the room next to me. Also, the hot water in my bathroom did not function, so I ended up taking a cold shower. Needless to say, the noise and lack of hot water made for a disappointing stay from the standpoint of comfort. Still, a good value with easy parking and not too far from either DC or Baltimore if you are visiting.	3.0
Front Desk Staff was not very friendly at check-in. Breakfast was a trainwreck do to soccer team taking complete ownership of the breakfast area. I would recommend the hotel because of its convenient location between VA beach and Norfolk downtown aside from the poor treatment displayed by the front desk staff.	3.0
Bad: There are not much things to do around apart from parks. If you look for a good restaurant, you may have to drive for 20 minutes or so. Good: Clean and comfortable room, friendly staff. It is close to Disney parks and about 20 drive to Universal parks and the airport. There is also free parks shuttle service provided.	5.0
I booked my trip with the understanding that I would be staying at a Hyatt Regency Hotel. I did not find out until I arrived that the hotel had changed hands as of Dec 1st and under construction.We arrived Christmas day. It was a mad house, a Chinesse Christian Convenetion was in progress, not a problem. The problem was that was the convention was the main focus of the hotel staff - no Coffee kiosk, no hotel shop and limited staff. We were able to get food from the Sports bar - not a very good experience, again no staff.The construction began at 8:00 AM and ended at 3:30 Mon through Friday.So loud we were moved 6 floors.	3.0

Our experience was ok. The room felt crammed with only 2 people. I didn't like the sink being outside of the bathroom. On the first day after checking in the TV would not turn on. Problem with the remote control. Once it came on some local channels were grainy. Not very clear. On the 3rd day housekeeping didn't take out trash, clean, or make the beds. I had to take out the trash myself. They only took towels out. I went and spoke to the front desk and a few hours later someone came and cleaned and replaced the towels. The breakfast area was small for the amount of people they have staying there.	3.0
Good - Large, essentially one-bedroom apartments. Bad - Aged, and poorly designed. The soft shell of the tub enclosure dipped between the joists when I stood in it. Good - Nice neighborhood. Bad - practically impossible to get a cab on time. Good - housekeeping staff goes out of their way. Bad - Front desk is horrible. They lack procedure, training and capability. Simple tasks were challenging. Don't count on getting a cab through the front desk unless you have 30-60 minutes to wait for one. Call the cab company yourself and make certain they have your name so some other frustrated customer doesn't take your cab. Good - they run a shuttle from the hotel to the Metro. Bad - there is no schedule and you have to look carefully for when they don't run, when they are doing a grocery store run, or when they are running to another facility they service. The Metro is across the street and down half a block from where they drop you off and pick you up. Since you don't know the schedule, you're standing on the street waiting. Dress appropriately and take an umbrella. There is no restaurant in the building. But there is a call in service which delivers food from many restaurants. I recommend this hotel IF you have your own car, are flexible about the age of the building, and don't rely on any services from the front desk.	3.0
We loved the pink hotel and will definitely be going back! It was clean, well furnished and the bed and bedding was heavenly!! Crisp white sheets with billowy comfort.

The hotel was nice but a bit old. The air conditioning did not work well in either of the rooms in which we stayed. In the evening we were told breakfast was available in the hotel.

I love this hotel. It was cheaper than the ones - Sheraton and Marriott on Canal - where a conference I was attending was held. The decor is beautiful (Erykah Badu-like art on the wall and retro galore with a bit of artisan flare). My room was at the end of the corner and I didn't hear a thing, a privilege when traveling in a major city. The front desk manager called later to see if I had a good stay. Shout-out to Kavana at the front desk who was kind up my check out and departure as well as the people working in the first floor restaurant. The endive salad and fish was a perfect meal. The roof top bar looked like a lot of fun, but aside from a quick snap shot, I didn't stay as I needed to decompress from my travels. But I shall return. 12-15 minute safe walk to the Quarter. Take Rampart or any parallel street to Canal and head toward river.Thank you for taking the time to review our property and we are delighted to know you had a great stay with us. It sounds like every part of your experience at our hotel was perfect which is music to our ears.

Hotel is perfectly situated for Angel's baseball games as it is within walking distance to the stadium. Free packing. Staff was very friendly and welcoming.

We stayed here because it was 1 on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed at all! It was such a great location with extremely friendly staff, we stayed an extra week! The manager, Terry, head of housekeeping, Leonor and our housekeeper, Tina were all very helpful with anything we needed / wanted! They were around on a regular basis to interact w/ guests and offer a friendly hello. It is a smaller hotel w/ only 9 floors, so we found it to be extremely quiet. It is located just 1/2 block from the beach so walking back and forth all day long was no big deal. They offer free towels and beach mats at the front desk as well! Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a GREAT value! We can't wait to get back! MM from CT	5.0

The hotel was surprisingly good. Our room was very clean and spacious for 2 people. The bed was extremely comfortable. I especially liked the pillows that they provided. It gave just the right amount of support to my neck to relieve the stress and fatigue after roaming in scorching Washington DC heat on 4th July weekend (100 F). Hotel staff was super helpful. As soon as we checked into our room, within half an hour hotel attendant provided couple of extra towels without requesting. I especially liked this nice gesture because anyone tired of traveling in hot weather will take a nice bath and would need extra towels for early morning next day. Breakfast was average in terms of variety and quality. Neighborhood is definitely not good. There are couple of police cars always in the Hotel campus. So walking to Metro station is out of question. I wish the free hotel shuttle frequency to metro station was like every 10 mins instead of half an hour. It hardly takes 2 mins by shuttle to reach the metro station. But if you miss it (we did miss by couple of mins, while waiting for the elevator to arrive), you have to wait half an hour for next shuttle. All in all it was nice experience. I would definitely stay again.	4.0
I stayed here on a work trip for 8 nights. My room was clean, breakfast was nice, staff was friendly! I'd do it again in a heartbeat. I also like the fact, that it's off of the busy street. But it only walking distance to the beach. They also do valet services which is nice.	4.0
We drove up from the San Francisco Bay area to meet our son in Redding. He goes to school in central Oregon so his drive was a little longer compared to ours.

Bad: Small rooms for American standards. Could have been cleaner. Towels were dirty. Average standard hotel, not as good as expected. Good: Very good location, one block from the beach (2 min walk). 3 min to Ocean Drive/Lummus Park, 5 min to Nikki Beach Club. Chairs and umbrellas on the beach from an external provider from 8.30 am to 6.30 pm included. Towels are provided. Valet parking 35 for 24h, no overnight street parking (day 4/h).	3.0
In a word - awful. Called early in the day to ask for a late check in lady was very sassy and snarky rather than just making a note on the reservation. Once actually checked in: room extremely tiny, AC unit very loud, bed uncomfortable. Housekeeping knocked at 8am to clean room - checkout wasn't until 10am...	1.0
THE WORST BREAKFAST OF ANY HOTEL I'VE EVER STAYED AT. WE HAD TO GO OUT EVERY MORNING FOR BREAKFAST. ROOM HAD DOG FOOD PELLETS ON THE FLOOR. POOR CLEANING OF ROOM.

They said my guest where welcomed once they got there they stopped them from comin up once again guess it was cause we where black. I will never return to this hotel from hell again.

FIrst, the young woman who works at the front desk should get a raise. She was one of the most pleasant and helpful hotel employees I have met. She was able to answer every question and didn't seem to mind that we asked the same ones several times. Second, breakfast was wonderful. Finally, location was perfect for the conference we needed to attend the following day. The only reason I rated surrounding neighborhood so low is that the hotel is surrounded by highways, but that adds to its convenience.	5.0

The room was okay. But bathroom extremely small. Also, it looked like the beginnings of black mold in between the caulking of the shower/bath tub surfaces. Toilet very low to the ground.... The uncomfortable contribution of the bathroom set the precedence for the sentiments felt about the hotel. But, it was a good location and the front desk staff were very helpful in pinpointing attractions and waterfalls in the area. I can't really comment on breakfast since we slept in and missed it daily	2.0
The staff was very friendly and helpful, responding quickly to requests. The facilities were comfortable and clean and we appreciated the little snack on arrival. Breakfast was tasty with good options.	5.0
Bad: The only negative was some mysterious in-room snack bar charges that appeared on my bill after I left. I contacted the hotel, and they promptly removed them. This has happened to me at other Starwood properties before, and I'm not sure why. Good: The hotel is in a great location and is clean/modern with a courteous staff.

I'm not really a big fan of this type of suite. The last thing I want to do on a vacation is cook or do dishes. But I just ignored the kitchen area and the hotel was better than fine.

Love the OMNI for many reasons, the only thing that is a huge disappointment each visit is the cigarette smoking being done in the outdoor areas that we are supposed to be able to enjoy fresh air (the pool, balconies, front door entrance). Rules need to be enforced, rude guests get mad if approached about taking smoking to appropriate areas.	5.0
First off there is no parking, valet is your only option which would be fine if it were a better hotel. Our AC didn't work, maintenance had to come reset it three times. Very inconvenient at 8pm, 11pm then again at 1am. The pool is a joke, it's more like a bathtub. And the amazing breakfast they advertise is no better than a Continental at most hotels. Over all it was a huge disappointment.	2.0
I have been coming to this hotel for 5 years now. There are several other places in the area, but I come here. The staff is the main reason I keep coming back.

Bad: Closest parking was a 4-5 minute walk away for 28 overnight. Closer parking is available for 48 overnight. Good: Great neighborhood on Boylston and a block from Newbury St. Plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance to choose from. It is one of the better values compared to other hotels in Boston. Half a block from the Copley T station if you want to get to another part of the city. 15- 20 minute walk to Fenway Park for the Sox game.	4.0
We stayed at this hotel the last week in December the weather was extremely cold, arrived 1 week after the snow storm but the hotel service was very warm. The shuttle service was excellent the would drop pick you up from any area inb their vicinity. Also need to mention that guest from another hotel was waiting in the cold at the mall and the shuttle driver offered to drop them to their hotel which was excellent service.

This is one of only a handful of times I have stayed at Hampton Inns. For the most part it was great.

Bad: I had made my reservations 3 months ago for a 1 night stay for my friends aND I. We have been making this trip for 40+ years, and are certainly used to paying premium hotel rates for very average hotel rooms due to the season and oceanfront property. However this hotel room was very disappointing. We were given a handicap access room.Keep in mind, we are able bodied, active middle-aged ladies who rin marathons. This room had a bathroom that provided a shower stall for a wheelchair access, thus no way to prevent water from the shower head to go all over the bathroom. What a mess! We basically had to sop up water from the floor after each of us showered. The rooms only provide double beds, so even for the smaller ladies, was a cramped sleeping experience. Upon registering and first entering the room, I asked if we could have another room option.The front desk declined indicating that other rooms were not available.So, we paid over 350 a night for a below standard room. They should have at least offered us a discount. We will seek other accommodations for our annual trip next year!. Good: Location is great. Easy access to the boardwalk and beach.Decent hot and cold complimentary breakfast.	3.0
Bad: Just want to say paying 330 for one night would have been nice too get breakfast included in the price. . Good: At least it wasnt too far from TD garden.	3.0
Perfect location to begin your exploration of Napa wine country. Tom at the registration desk was wonderful, he could not have been nicer and more helpful. Our room was large and clean and had a refrigerator and microwave. Would absolute stay here again!!!Janly - Wow! Thank you for your kind review. I will make sure Tom sees it as well, he is pretty wonderful. We are so thrilled you enjoyed your stay and we can't wait to see you again. Genafer, Director of Sales	4.0
We stayed 2 nights. This was a nice place to stay. The room was nice, but the bed was hard as a rock. If you like an extra firm bed, then this is for you. We both had back aches from the bed. The service in the restaurant in the lobby was not so good. After the bartender had to... More	4.0

still very good. I would say though that this is not the second ranking hotel in Chesapeake as it was listed the last tie I looked at the ratings. The corridors could use new carpeting.

The bed was good in room 110. The bathroom was massive without shelving, and thus there was no place to set things. Outlets were in short supply. Room was spacious and clean.

First come first serve basis should be put in effect. Rooms were assigned before guests checked in and prevented me from getting a much wanted side of the hotel.

The room was spacious enough, beds were okay, and it had a refrigerator, microwave and coffeemaker, and a complimentary breakfast.

Mandatory stay while in Nola...the hotel is Centrally located to restaurants, French quarter, garden district or warehouse district! They have bikes to be used to tour the city. The service was impeccable and there 24 hours. The bar area very nice-I travel here every two months...you must make the Aloft your hotel of choice when in Nola.Easy access to everything NOLA has to offer is key to a great stay and having the bike rental on site makes it that much easier. We are glad you got to take advantage of our central local and hope to see you in two months!	5.0
The Aloft came as advertised. It was more modern than the pictures on their website might lead you to believe. Green option was good, they do not refresh unless you ask them to. Nice bar with pretty good food in the hotel. 15 minutes or so to walk to the river and French Quarter. Staff were friendly and accomodating.Yay! We love when we exceed your expectations and thank you for letting us know. Appreciate the kind words and we look forward to seeing you back at Aloft New Orleans Downtown.	4.0

I booked this stay with my mother, sister and niece. The hotel was in a great location and close to many conveniences. The staff were always pleasant and helpful. The free Laundromat was also a huge plus. As our visit was for 10 days, the kitchenette in the room proved very convenient and we were also happy to notice that the hotel was not noisy. My only negative was that the hotel windows could not open and sometimes it proved difficult to get the air conditioning at a comfortable setting. Overall a great stay!	4.0
The area and hotel was packed due to the fall leaf season.

Chose this hotel because we were sharing the 2 bedroom/ 2 bath unit with elderly parents who were to fly in from DFW area. Bad weather cancelled their flight two days in a row. I called the morning after we checked in to explain situation. We wanted to see if we could get smaller room since it was just the two of us instead of four. Stayed on hold for sometime waiting for manager to get on phone. We were unable to change room because we had booked through Hotels.com.	3.0

The ad says that the rooms have been redone and the pictures look great, but in reality we had a poorly patched hole in the bathroom door, rusty tub fixtures, and the obviously new paint was chipping. Comforters looked new, but the sheets were super scratchy. Also, it is a motel style place (which was not clear from the ad), which means people smoke off the balcony outside their room and the air conditioner sucks the gross smoky smell into your room. It was fine for last minute since literally nothing else was available last minute for the night were were staying for business in DC, but normally for an extra 20 bucks you could find something MUCH nicer.	3.0

I made a reservation through Expedia. I'd read an article saying that all the rooms had been refurbished, so I thought I was OK.

What a terrible experience. I reserved and prepaid through Hotels.com. I arrived close to midnight because of flight delays and was informed that the hotel was overbooked and that they had moved me to a hotel in Alexandria - 20 minutes away. I received no phone call, email or contact either from the Hotel or Hotels.com. The hotel they moved me too was in no way an equivalent hotel (half the price and they wouldn't refund me the difference which required me to through a fairly efficient but inconvenient process to call Hotels.com and request a refund), incredibly inconvenient and they also made me pay for a second cab to get there. I would not recommend unless there was absolutely no alternative. The night manager was at least friendly and sympathetic but powerless to do anything.	1.0
The location is just amazing. I was in Miami for a business conference, however I wanted to actually enjoy my stay so I booked this hotel. It is right on the beach and has amazing views.

The room was very clean, but the AC could not be controlled and we froze at night. I could not turn it off and it ran all night long. I didn't have time to get the staff to fix it, so I just covered the vents with clothes to keep it from blowing out so much. We were still cold. The pool was nice, but the work out center was a joke and only on of three tread mills worked. And there was no weights or anything else. The Breakfast was a joke. There was only cereal and toast and that's it. We didn't even eat it, we just went out on our way to our events.	3.0

Bad: quite a bit of noise from the upstairs 'neighbors.' They could do better with soundproofing... also, the breakfast was a bit weak. Eggs overcooked, somewhat tasteless and kind of cold, no specialty coffee drinks available and not much for healthy options. if you have a car, beware that for all intents and purposes the valet parking is required, and will run an extra 35/night. Good: lovely decor, super friendly and helpful bilingual staff. Bed was comfortable and the shower was good.	4.0

My only one complaint is that you have not mentioned your phone number in the web site( when I took the print out after booking, there is no phone number on the sheet).

Rooms greatly exceeded expectations. Nice and clean. Seems like a sketchy area, but I am sure once renovations are complete and the parking lots has more cars that perception will change. For the price you can't beat it. Shower head had great water pressure which always makes everything better.	4.0
This motel was a good surprise. Our room was very clean, and still smelled of bleach. The floor is hardwood, not carpet. I guess it's because of the pets allowed it's also easier to clean. Overall, this motel is an excellent option in Escalante, and don't miss the attached restaurant (Circle D eatery), which is very good.	5.0
The staff was very friendly and nice, the bed was comfortable, but there were ants on the walls, in the bathroom - we kept our suitcases zipped to make sure we didn't take any with us! Fortunately the bed was clean and ant-free. The room was clean - they just had a problem with ants which should have been taken care of. The front desk guy, a very friendly young man, did tell s when we left that the were doing complete renovations in the next few months, so this problem might soon be solved.	2.0

A disorderly mess from the start. When we checked in and got up to our room it wasn't clean and the beds were not made. On the second day of our stay we returned to our room at 4:00 to find the room has not been cleaned but our towels had been removed and items had been moved in our room. When we inquired, the manager stated no one has been in our room insisting we had been the only ones to enter. At no point was he apologetic or reasonable in regards to our concerns. At this point I decided to check out. I made the error of prepaying through Expedia and now the hotel is avoiding their attempts to refund the nights I did not stay. A terrible experience all around in a poorly managed hotel.	1.0
Check in was quick. Room was clean. About 11pm we called to the front desk for a blanket. 15 minutes later, still not there. We called back to the front desk, to inquire as to the blankets location. We were then told they did not have available staff to bring it up. I went to the front desk to retrieve it. Surprise, 2 people at the desk. The next morning I called for some towels. 20 minutes later, called again. Another 20 minutes, we were sharing towels. They never showed. One of the adults in our party found bed bugs! I went down to the front desk and asked for a manager. He did not want to come out of his room, stating he didn't get back to his room until very late. After some insistance, he showed up. His answer was to give me a 10 gift card to Target. I like most of the Garden Inns we have stayed at. This one will never see me again.	2.0
Although my hotel rooms was great and the location was great there were a few things that will cause me not to return. The PARKING which they charged me 16 a day was horrible. The spots are so small that compact cars barely fit much less an intermediate or an ever so popular SUVs. Everyone went over the line making it impossible to find a spot and if you were lucky enough to find a spot and get into it, you couldn't get out of your car, most of the time it took me 15-30 minutes to park just because of the lot. The other thing I didn't like was no help with bags. They provided you with carts, but then there were stairs you had put your things in a dummy elevator and send them up or down and being an older person the maneuvering of the cart itself was cumbersome.	4.0
I have been here since August 2015. Compared to the last two places I stayed, this is the best. There is a full kitchen and the bed is amazingly comfortable.

The room was fine, with two exceptions: I was placed in a room adjacent to the elevator shafts, and the wall air conditioning unit was excessively noisy. Consequently, even with ear plugs, it was not easy to get a good night's sleep for me. The A/C unit was easy to turn off, but it would have been difficult to prevent guests from using the elevators!	3.0
We had a nice stay, some family in other rooms near us. Floor was a bit slippery--not from uncleanliness, just wood floors--but otherwise we had a wonderful stay.	5.0
Had a great stay, however no real complaints. I'm very picky with where I stay. The staff was beyond friendly, the hotel was well kept. They even had snacks when you enter and leave the hotel at the front door. Was very pleased. The only small issue was that the carpet in the room needed shampooing. I normally bring my slippers and forgot this time. Carpet had hair on floor needs better vacuuming and shampoo the walls in the room need touch up paint. It would literally take 20 min for when a quest leaves for walls to be touched up every so often. That was my only issue looking at a dirty wall. However I would stay again. Why are the racks for the towels inside the shower on the wall. Bad idea makes them get damp when you shower.	5.0
We recently stayed at this fantastic property in Downtown Charleston for a weekend to attend a wedding reception of a close friend's son.

unhappyr We camped there last year. This year we considered going back but the river has flooded the area and our campsite is still muddy and it is July 18th. The owner still wants the full summers rate for camping which, by the way, she raised the prices this year. The owner is constantly sitting at her picnic table and scowls at the campers. She doesn't smile. When she told us that the rates couldn't be discounted we told her that we wouldn't be camping there this year. She said fo...view morer us to get our stuff out of there in one week or she would call the authorites. She said we couldn't camp there ever again. Her son is wonderful and helps his mom run the campground but he has to listen to his controlling mother. She also charges 2 dollars a head for visitors. She's all about the almightly dollar. She called us unfaithful. She even doesn't like our 2 little daschunds. They need to be tied up. Save yourself some money and heartache. DON'T STAY HERE!r r rview less	1.0
We checked in and left the Econo Lodge down the road, and found a room at Best Western. Much better room, and much better area for dogs. The Econo had a high TripAdvisor rating, but it was a shabby place with a strip of grass for dogs. The grass was full of fire ants too.	4.0

I must not have read any of these negative reviews when I booked this room over a month ago. None of them are exaggerating. We drove out here 4 days before checking in to check it out.

Within walking distance of major attractions.Rooms were clean and comfortable.Breakfast was simply delicious.The highlight for our family was how friendly all the staff were.Would stay there in a heartbeat.We went to the zoo and it started to pour,one of the desk ladies lent us her own umbrella,just blew us away.	5.0

My wife fell in love with this resort the moment she entered the room. The view was gorgeous and the resort was kid friendly. The kitchen was nice and clean so was the laundry room. We wished we could stay longer than we planed.	5.0
Bad: The room needs to be updated. The bathroom fixtures needs to be renovated. The layout of the room was a little a awkward, there needs to be better lighting and a vanity under the large mirror. The property itself could use use an update as well, it needs to be modernized. Good: It was close to all the activities on Fremont Street. I enjoyed being in the center of Downtown, everything was within walking distance.	4.0
This hotel is excellent for the rate. Clean and quiet for the class of hotel. Everybody in the group had the same opinion and wouldn't hesitate to stay again. Easy on and of the highway with plenty of good restaurants close.	3.0
The bathroom stunk. Carpet dirty. The front clerk was not very nice. Restaurant closed early. Snow plowing was poor and the person plowing was not paying attention very well.	2.0

I have never been disappointed by a Hampton Inn and this one maintains that track record. The staff was helpful and friendly. The rooms and most importantly bathrooms were clean and smelled nice. And the price was right. For my purposes the location was convenient, so I have no complaints.	5.0
Was not pleased that it rained my stay because I did not have a chance to visit the pool. The food at the grill was really good! Great turkey club and burger!! Awesome drinks......needed more alcohol but good. Shuttle from airport little slow but staff wanted to make you comfortable.	5.0
Went down to San Antonio for a weekend trip and I must say that I was quit impressed with the hotel and staff. Excellent on my end!	4.0

The hotel has seen better days, but certainly a step up from the low-end chains. Didn't try pool, but fitness equip was fairly rickety. Good restaurants nearby, and good value for the area. Overall pleased.	4.0
We liked the hotel very much. The room was quite cosy. There was a shuttle service to the nearest subway station. The only thing I did not like is that our check-in receptionist wanted us to pay only by card. But the payment conditions of our cards do not allow taking money without entering a PIN code and by ourselves. The receptionist insisted by demanding if otherwise a 200 deposit (we had not known about this condition before) and we agreed about the card. The payment result in one day was declined payment and a blocked by our bank card (as the bank considered the payment suspicios or the card as stolen by an American). So, finally we paid cash. Please, respect customers and their banks' attempt to protect them. But altogether I did like our stay there and enjoyed it.	4.0

I've stayed at this motel multiple times over the years. This motel works well to give you a nice warm place to stay overnight in the cold winter months.

We recently spent one night at the Best Western in Lake Placid. It is conveniently located near the center of town, across from the skating arena. The facility is adequate, and offers a complementary breakfast. The parking is very difficult and it is not easy to get an SUV out of the parking lot area.	3.0
This was a last minute booking. You walk into clean hotel that doesn't smell like smoke. Staff was great and checked us in along with explaining the times for breakfast buffet, wifi access and other necessities. Room was big and clean. Soft bed, clean bedding, modern decor, kitchen with all necessities and clean bathroom. If I return definitely coming back here.	5.0
this hotel was dumpy. the layout was strange. I will probably never stay at a La Quinta again.	2.0
We decided to try the Americana Hotel for a night. Pluses: clean room, comfortable bed, nice TV with lots of cable. Breakfast (free) was pretty thin: donuts/bagels, oatmeal or cereal.

The hotel is OK ,the guy on the front desk was very nice ,the rooms are OK BUT in the morning I had a few bed bug bites and there is no continental breakfast just protein bars . On top of that upon check out I ask the lady at the front desk for a receipt and she told me she can't give me one cuz I book the room over the Internet but when I checked in I signed a paper with the amount and just wanted a copy of that page but she refused to give me cuz it was for the hotel use only ...

My plans to use my 2 free hyatt nights in Mexico fell through but time was running out so even though I thought I was going to be wasting them by staying at Hyatt House in Seattle, I didn't have a choice. As it turns out, I made an excellent choice. Though not a luxury hotel in Mexico, our visit to Hyatt House was wonderful! Check in was straightforward and easy (with the best service ever, but more on that later). Once we were moved (by request) out of the strange angled corner room with a view that looked out on another room, we were absolutely delighted with our stay!! The room was surprisingly quiet despite being next to the street and near the Seattle Center Activities. We loved the location, literally across the street from the Space Needle! The view of the Space Needle outside our window was romantic and the rooftop terrace provide an unparalleled 360 degree view of the city. The room layout was really cool and the decor is very modern (like a boutique hotel). The bed was very comfortable (firm but not hard). A (very) minor complaint is the textured fabric of the bedspread, which was a bit rough to the touch, but the sheets were crisp and smooth. Another minor detail was that I missed having a tub for soaking, but the rain shower turned out to be fine (lots of space in shower, could use a seat or shelf for sitting) Lots of storage space (as well as hangers) if you are staying a few days and want to unpack. The kitchen was fully stocked including dish soap, which seems unusual in hotels these days for some reason I don't understand. The free hotel shuttle was a great value and breakfast was decent- a pretty good selection though crowded on Sunday morning. he only thing that wasn't perfect about our stay was the fact that housekeeping never came the second day. We put the sign on the door and saw the housekeeper next door as we were leaving, but for some reason our room was skipped. It's always nice to come home to a freshened-up room and a made bed. We had enough towels to get us through, so it was fine, especially given that everything else was so good. Saving the best part for last, let me say that more than anything I have described, what we liked most by far, about our stay at Hyatt House, was the absolutely amazing service provided by Eden at the front desk! Everyone at the front desk was truly great, but she was a shining star! I'm not sure I've ever experienced a more genuine welcome or felt as appreciated as a customer as she made my husband and I feel. Thanks to her, this was a perfect weekend getaway!	5.0
Excellent stay! The room was beautiful, comfortable and clean. Sheets were crisp and very white. Food was superior to the usual hotel fare.

We rented 1 bedroom plus den from vrbo . Great resort with condos with a feel of a hotel. Many pools, BBQ, dukes restaurant on site, ocean front, great snorkeling off the beach. The kids had a fantastic time. Grocery store tymes is right there, we had a kitchen we could cook and buy groceries.!	4.0
Bad: I think the hotel could do more to promote the on site restaurant with newly arrived guests. My husband tried it and thought the food was great but if there'd been a deal or something to catch our attention I'm sure we'd have eaten breakfast there both mornings of our stay. I also think that although the space inside the rooms seems to be well used that there are some practical challenges with storage where existing space could be better used for the ease and comfort of guests. Good: Very comfortable beds. Not massive but cosy and we all slept well. The linens were clean and fresh and we enjoyed the L'Occitane products in the bathroom. The staff were friendly, kind and helpful.	5.0

We love to stay at W Hotels when we travel. This was a business trip and the stay was pleasant. The room was more than adequate. We were disappointed that there were NO drawers in the furniture in the room, so we had to improvise and stack things on the desk. The room was clean and the staff was pleasant. We would definitely choose this location on our next Austin business trip.	4.0

A basic, dated motel. On the positive side, it was very welcoming when I arrived and the room was clean and tidy. I can see the (newish) owner have made an effort, but really the property is in need of more upgrading than it's received.	3.0

I didn't stay. I checked in for about an hour and was totally disgusted from what I saw and smelled..Room was dirty, the sliding glass door was broken and it had no screen to cover the door if u opened it. Furniture was broken, the refrigerator was dirty, the curtains had cigarette burns and dirt marks all over them. I would not recommend this hotel at all.	1.0
Bad: I didn't appreciate the attitude of a few of the female employees in regards to the nightclub. I also would prefer a little more variety in the DJ's music choice. It seemed like ALL techno versions and sometimes we just want to hear the ACTUAL songs mixed. Other than that, I loved the property. Good: I loved the decor. Everything about the hotel from the lobby to the room was fantastic. The wood floors, the floor-to-ceiling windows, the shower overlooking the bedroom... PHENOMENAL! I loved the modern, but still comfortable feel. All employees I came in contact with had fantastic customer service skills with the exception of a few in the nightclub. Overall, this property is definitely on my list of Chicago properties as we visit often. Next time we will try out the spa as we didn't get a chance this visit.	5.0

This is not a super luxurious hotel with expensive furniture and fancy rooms. But for what it is, a chain with the usual rooms and extras, it is everything one could ask for. We were checked in by a pleasant and helpful clerk. The room was clean and quiet with a microwave oven, refrigerator, a large TV, and free WiFi. We used the laundry and fitness room facilities which were modern and clean. One of us chose the standard breakfast (coffee or tea, two eggs, sausage or bacon, toast or hash browns), offered at the Denny's next door, which was free. The other got 5 toward one of the other breakfasts offered on the menu. Both were satisfactory. We would stay there again.Thank you for your review and we will see you on your next visit to Napa.	4.0
Best service all round For the price you pay the rooms are clean and spacious. Facilities could be improved within apartments but nothing that was un comfortable. The receptionist were helpful and friendly. Would recommend to anyone	5.0
I'd never heard of the Oxford Suites, so wasn't sure what to expect. Wow, what a pleasant surprise! Don't let the price (approx 100 per night ) scare you away. Sure you can hunt for a lower priced hotel in Redding for 70-80 a night- BUT I sincerely doubt they'll have the services and extras that the Oxford offers! Beautiful,... More	5.0
My husband and I were driving cross-country for a move with two cats, so our requirements for lodging were relatively clean, safe, cheap and pet-friendly. This hotel met all of those.

With an air of urban sophistication and a location that can't be beat The St. Regis occupies the corner of 5th and 55th only blocks from Central Park, MOMA and the best retail shopping in America. On a cold winter afternoon loaded with bags displaying the logos of the finest brands guests are greeted at the elevator with a choice of hot apple cider, chocolate or beef broth. Recently remodeled rooms are roomy by NYC standards and fresh and of course the Butler service puts it's over the top. I don't think you can find a better lounge for a casual drink then the King Cole Bar. Don't miss the Bloody Mary menu (a drink that was invented here). An oasis, a grand hotel, a total pleasure.Dear Gene B,Thank you very much for your kind words about our hotel. We are so pleased that you enjoyed your stay in a renovated room and were able to enjoy our holiday hot chocolate offering. We hope you have a wonderful holiday season and we look forward to seeing you again in 2015.Best Regards,Manuel MartinezHotel Manager	5.0

The hotel is well located. The room was great. Staff very helpful and polite. Breakfast was not the best.	5.0
This hotel was extremely clean, modern, and had a small town feel with staff attitudes and helpfulness!! It typically stay at Hilton brands, usually the Homewood Suites, DoubleTree, or Embassy Suites, but since this Hampton was only a few miles from where we were working, we opted to stay at the Hampton. It was a very nice surprise for the... More	5.0
Bad: Breakfast can be better. Its very simple, I had to go out and seek for a real breakfast because the hotel option was not attractive at all. Good: Very good location. Our room was good, you get what you pay, anything more.	4.0
The location of this place is prime. The hotel condition, on average is nice. I found my room fantastic, with a kitchenette and living room. The elevators were old and confusing (only one went to the garage, but you could not call just that one and there were no stairs).Breakfast was average-- the scrambled eggs were really dry and so were the waffles/french toast.Some of the staff were kind and helpful, but many didn't seem to care and others seemed new. Maybe this location had a high influx of new front desk members at the time of my stay. There are two kiosks at the front desk, and a phone between. While I was checking in, the other kiosk was also occupied by a staff member assisting a customer, and another staff member was using the phone between to talk loudly to a service member about a customer who had not had their room cleaned in three days. This was concerning, distracting, and off-putting. This also distracted the lady helping me check in from doing her job.One night, we were awoken by a very loud banging noise coming from the room next to us close to midnight. The banging, accompanied by yelling, continued for several minutes. Worried and scared, I called the front desk, but the person who answered didn't seem to care about the situation and at first didn't offer a solution until I asked if there was nothing they could do, and they said they would send somebody up there again. The front desk staff member said the lady had been locked out by her partner who had deadbolted the door. By this point, the lady had been standing outside her room yelling and banging on the door for half an hour (by her account-- overheard when she yelled at her partner when he finally opened the door). I'm worried that the staff allowed this to continue for so long. What if the partner had been suffering a medical emergency, or had never opened the door Nobody followed up with us regarding this issue, which was disappointing. Had someone touched base in the morning and apologized for the inconvenience, I likely wouldn't be writing this review.Upon checkout, the front desk staff threw away a handwritten not eaddressed to me as a guest of the company whose conference I was attending because my partner was performing the checkout. Overall, I was really let down by my stay here. The rooms are so nice and the location is great. I thought the Hyatt brand could be trusted with providing a great, seamless customer experience, but it didn't seem like they cared.Hello and thank you for taking the time to share your experiences at our hotel with us. First, I offer my sincere apologies for the poor care shown to you by my team. We are in the process of training several new additions to our staff but this does not excuse the lack of professionalism and lack of interest in resolving your concerns promptly and with care. Please know that I have addressed your concerns with my team so that we can continue to improve our quality of care. If I can be of any additional assistance, please contact me directly.	2.0
The hotel staff, Ms. Vundee (I think this is how you spell her name) was an excellent hostess/ waitress in the breakfast room, she made the experience worthwhile. She was the only one who was very welcoming, cheerful, informative, caring in general a very good leader (she deserves a raise). The others in the front desk were average. The full breakfast was good with many options!	5.0
I booked last min, the night before. It showed Family Suite. It was still cheaper then most everything in the area. Booked on TripAdvisor reviews and location. Checkin was at 3pm, as shown.

Rude desk person, smelly room. Initially, I politely asked to change rooms because of a funny smell.

We were there for only 8 hours, but it was convenient and good for a quick sleep. Was thrown off by the 10 charge for the pet, when it wasn't mentioned in the reservation process. We were told pets were welcome, but no additional charge. We had some rambunctious neighbors, and the office took care of the issue as soon as we called down to the office, so that was great!	3.0
Hotel keys are required to lift the gate to the parking area which was a nice feature. Very close to Cumberland Mall and tons of restaurants and shops.

This was a weekend get away for my husband's birthday. When we first arrived, the receptionist was pleasant but screwed up my information. Kept telling me that my credit card had declined I had booked through another travel company when I clearly showed her my reservation status verified that my credit card was in good standing. She then, goes get a manager who had gotten everything taken care of but didn't apologize on their end. After going through that (holding up the line because she was the only one working) she then tells us that the computer was down so she couldn't issue us room keys. We asked what were we supposed to do She said that she would send house keeping to out floor to let us in. House keeping even struggled to get in had to get another person to open the door. Finally, enter the room checked it thoroughly. Room was dusty bathroom sink was clogged when I washed my hands. Take a shower later on, and water leaked all over bathroom floor. Checked back 3 hours later for the room keys she told us the machine was still down so we had to wait an additional hour or so. Upon check out the next morning, a different young lady ask how was our stay, I explained briefly our experience. She then tried to cover up for the hotel saying Oh, it's just that the building is older and gave us a free breakfast ticket which the food was nasty Luke warm (NOT HOT). Very disappointed! Will not be staying here again.	3.0
We were glad to find a great place for a great price. We even got out for a walk after our flight and found the area to be safe and easy to walk around. The people were nice and the breakfast decent. We'd definitely recommend it.	5.0
Following a fourteen hour drive, we arrived, very tired, to check in at 3 AM on April 17th. I booked a non-smoking room but there was only a smoking room available. We were given the keys to room 410. This is an outside room in the back of the hotel that abuts a truck stop.  I used the bathroom which had water all over the floor, and went back into the main room. The room had stained carpets, lights that didnt work and things just didnt seem particularly clean. However, the bed was nicely made and we were very tired. I pulled back the bed spread to find rumpled sheets covered in blood. I chose to contact Expedia, whose representative contacted the front desk and arranged for a refund of all three reservations booked with this hotel. At my request Expedia also arranged for us to stay at a different hotel in the area. I do not believe that it takes much intelligence to connect the dots and determine what happened here.When we were back in town on Friday we stopped back to the hotel in an attempt to speak with the manager. We were told that he was not in.  I left a message asking that he call me, to which there has been no response. Even though this is a two star hotel, these conditions are disgusting.	1.0
Reasonable rates with free breakfast and right in front of Gaylord National Resort worked for me very well. The rooms have good size bathrooms and the air conditioning in the rooms was excellent.

When I booked this room, I knew there was a separate living area, but had no idea of the real size of the place. It was huge for a hotel room.

This motel is in an excellent location at a reasonable price for the area. The room was very clean and had a refrigerator and microwave. It is about a five minute drive from the downtown area. If you are a Best Western Rewards member, the room charge includes a breakfast at Denny's, which is located on the same property. It is not the regular breakfast menu however, it has a variety of selections and we were happy with the amount of food provided.cinann - Thank you for taking the time to write this review. Our entire staff takes pride in our hotel and it shows inside and out. Our prices are very reasonable for the Napa Valley. Being just a few minutes from Downtown Napa and wineries in the area, you just can't beat that. Thank you for being a Best Western Rewards Member and we hope you visit us again soon.

From the moment I arrived I had the best experience. The hotel was located near several restarants that were within walking distance and the hotel even had room servicee.

Overall great service and if I go back to the area I will definitely look into staying there again!	5.0

My wife and I stayed at the Virginian Suites for 8 days in October. Overall, it was a very enjoyable stay. The only drawbacks were the lumpy pillows and the dripping bathtub (it was in another room, however, and was not a distraction except when one was in the bathroom). We brought it to the attention of the staff as we checked out and they said they would send someone up to look at it. The hotel setting is lovely - just a short walk to a lovely park and the Iwo Jima memorial in Arlington Cemetary. There are two restaurants within a five minute walk of the hotel and leftovers can easily be kept and reheated in the suite's compact kitchen. There is ample parking on the premises for automobiles and the hotel shuttle makes morning and evening runs to the nearest metro station (which is walkable in a pinch) and will take you to the grocery store as well. The suites are large and comfortable and we will probably use them again if we return to Washington.	5.0

Everything went well till about 130 am when we were woke from a peaceful sleep of someone trying to enter our room. I went to the door to find another couple who told me we were in their room. Apparently the front desk booked our room twice. We never were able to get back to sleep which was a major problem as I was there for surgery the next morning at John Hopkins. My wife was given a free breakfast ( I was unable to eat due to the surgery) and we were told we would receive a free voucher for a free night in the the future in the mail. As of the writing of this we still have not received anything that was promised. This hotel was the BWI Hilton.	1.0

We stayed here for a trip to Disneyland. The good: 1 bedroom suite was very large. The bedroom area was small but the living area was huge. Great working/desk area and very nice kitchenette with a nearly full sized refrigerator, small stove, microwave, etc. Some things were recently renovated and looked very nice. The staff was great, helpful and friendly. Location was great, lots of stuff nearby, on the ART route to Disney and close to freeways. Breakfast was small but a decent selection - the waffles were really good and they had trays so that you could take food back to your room. The bad: some parts of the hotel have not been renovated, so there is a mix of new/nice and old/run down in the same room (i.e bathroom counters were nice, but the rest of the bathroom was dated. Old dresser in the bedroom, but tv's were nicer. The carpeting was old, and the door to the room was worn and actually had some non matching paint spots covering some type of damage, but the kitchenette was very nice as was the desk area and newer cabinets that were part of the desk area. For having a large living space, there wasn't a lot of seating. So, there was a small sofabed, and a table with just one chair. It would be nice to have the table and 4 chairs so that if multiple people are in the room (a standard family) there would be places to sit as the couch would only really fit 2-3 people. the other bad was that while I booked the room using Marriott points and was told that they would only place a 40 hold for incidentals on my credit card, the system automatically puts a hold for 170 for each night of your stay, unless the clerk removes your card info and overrides the system. I didn't know this until i looked online at my credit card account. Fortunately, Sam at the front desk was great and got the hold for the first night removed and made sure that no hold was placed on the 2nd night. Still though, unsettling to have some unexpected holds on your account. I've never had that happen at any other marriott property. I also had trouble connecting to the wifi, it kept giving me an error that I couldn't log into the wifi with my room number and last name. But, it actually still connected me on all devices I tried, so I just ignored the error and it worked just fine.Martha C.Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate.

After reading terrible reviews, dated a year ago, I was pleasantly surprised that renovations at this motel were complete. My room and bath were clean and new. The bedding was clean and pleasant smelling. The airconditioning was life saving. Check in and check out were as easy as ABC. The cost for a solo guest was well worth the charge. The complimentary breakfast was eye opening. I would not hesitate to stay here again since Waynetown, Indiana does not have a motel.	4.0
I don't write many five-star reviews. But this place is great. For starters, I fouled up my reservation and it automatically cancelled. The cheerful, amazing Danita at the front desk fixed me right up and was able to make me a new reservation, which was lucky since hotels in this area are often filled to capacity and one can be...

It was fun to relax with a beer and a great burger and watch bustling 3rd Avenue. We had an enjoyable visit with our college son up from UO and his buddies and our daughter. very enjoyable.	4.0
This was a comfortable and affordable five night stay I was in Detroit for a business and I brought my family.	4.0
Bad: Complimentary breakfast. Good: Location was great, right where we wanted to see some attractions. Free breakfast was a little misleading, (just say appetizers, and fruit basket). But overall, would definitely recommend, and stay again. Staff was good, and room was quiet.	5.0
The hotel was close to my family who we were visiting. The staff were outstanding.	5.0
Stayed at the Best Western Plus in Glenview overnight with a friend. She had a business meeting late that morning not far from the motel. We had time to eat the breakfast which was great as was the coffee. Usual fare of waffles, yogurt, and fruit. I must say that the scrambled eggs tasted homemade. The Canadian bacon was dry....

When we checked in and proceded up to our room, we went into the room to find they had a maintainence worker still working on something in the bathroom! They had no other rooms available, so they just hurried him up with whatever he was fixing. Tour groups of young adults, who seemed to have no supervision, were allowed to run up and down the hallways and stairs at all hours of the night! They even had ball games they were playing in the halls, and were calling other guests rooms with prank phone calls. When we called down to complain (about 11:00PM), we were told we needed to be patient! This went on every night of the trip, and we were there 8 days!	3.0

We travel to Boston every year and this hotel is where we always stay.

Check-in was easy. Parked in the free parking, which is a rarity in Seattle.

Parking in the garage is tight, but it was doable in our rented Camry land... More	5.0
This was a nice hotel. They had a small pool but a decent size hot tube. Just a large shower no bathtubs which I prefer it the kids aren't with us. Rate was pretty good. 99 a night for king bed. It had the sink out side the bathroom which I like so the mirror isn't fogged up when you... More	4.0
Bad: The area around the hotel is a bit rough with the tenderloin being so close the streets around the hotel are not the nicest. You really have to get an uber or use public transport to get somewhere for a nice walk in the evening. The one positive on the location is that you are near to a transport hub so easy to get away from the area. Good: Hotel facilities were great. Breakfast at the restaurant was good and the bar served nice cocktails. Lots of games are bonus when waiting for people or something to do before bed. The hotel rooms are comfortable and spacious.	4.0
Nice spacious rooms, good location . The only thing bad about it is that they don't have buffet breakfast and it takes lot of time to get a table and it becomes quite expensive too. 2 of the mornings, I was offered high chairs of bar for breakfast which is not ideal when you pay about 60 dollars for simple omlette, juice and black coffee. But overall very good.Dear neeraj821,Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at The St. Regis New York, and thank you for your comments regarding breakfast.

We stayed on the second floor near the elevator. We loved our room and the location. They serve an excellent breakfast everyday and wine and cheese each afternoon. The courtyard is lovely place for breakfast and Indigo is within walking distance to historic Charleston. The staff was friendly and very attentive. Would definitely return.	5.0
The art deco decor and large floor to ceiling windows created a festive yet zen atmosphere. There was a hiccup upon check-in with the system being down but generally speaking, service was great and staff very friendly. After check-out I realized I was charged for something incorrectly and Chris addressed it immediately and was able to correct it without hesitation. Great location and intimate feel came with friends but will revisit with spouse.Thank you so much for taking the time to review your recent stay with us and we are delighted to know you had a great stay. We appreciate the feedback as it's very important to us and we will be sure to commend Chris for resolving the issue you encountered quickly and efficiently. It was a pleasure to have you as our guest and look forward to having you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,	5.0
Bad: When I made the reservation, they told me one thing. When I got there, the first person told me something different. Third person resolved it.

Embassy Suites as a chain is great. Who else offers the manager special and great breakfast buffet that, to us, is the hallmark of their hotel. However, I was disappointed with the service in Linthicum, MD during our stay. I did not feel the front desk was friendly or had smiles. I hate dealing with customer service that you feel you are inconveniencing. If you have kids that stay with you on the fold-out couch, they never have extra bedding in the room, if you want to make up the bed. We asked the front desk for the extra bedding. It wasn't provided. We called housekeeping. No answer. We called the desk, and eventually housekeeping brought up extra towels. Eventually, housekeeping brought up some bedding with a repeat call to the desk. The next morning their was no receipt on the floor by your door like most hotels. Because we didn't just wanted to go in the morning, after our yummy breakfast (during which mindful busboys kept our table clear of extra, now emptied dishes), we just wanted to pack up and leave without stopping by the desk. This was probably a big mistake, because I found out the next weekend, that the Linthicum charged us for the room on top of what I already paid hotels.com. That was incredibly annoying. What if never had checked my account. Could this have happened at another time, at one of their other locations Thankfully, a call to the polite desk supervisor took care of it for us. We're supposed to get a credit in a few days.	4.0

Great place to stay while doing the Charleston tourist attractions. Much cheaper than staying downtown, and the shuttle bus takes you into the city from a stop just outside the hotel, so no parking charges.Some maintenance issues with the room which were not all fixed during our stay. Internet was slow but free. Breakfast was the usual HIE fare.Staff were all keen to help, but the hotel is probably feeling its age.	4.0

Stayed a few days while on business, big mistake. I don't want an experience from my Hotel - I want value for my money. No Closet, No dressers, No coffee maker, No Frig, No Microwave, No Bathtub, No Iron, No ice machines, No room service, No Workspace and of course no free breakfast. They give you a poker chip for one free coffee or drink. It is geared towards those who don't need any of these amenities and want to hang out in a noisy bar environment for your computer work. They give you a small tray table about 15x15 inches to work on in your room, that doesn't cut it for me. I get the revenue play with putting more rooms in a much small piece of real estate but for the nightly cost, a business traveler can find much nicer hotels in Chicago. I would suggest an improvement would be to have a fold up table on the wall and a chair at least. Traveler beware if your are on business (especially a women) this is most likely not the place for you - unless you just want tacos and the free lollypop from room service. I think the Do Not Disturb sign with the young guy in his under ware hugging a teddy bear says it all.	2.0
This hotel is, to put it gently, a little out of the way. But it's close to major routes (93, 495) and the town of Andover is a short drive away as are Lowell and Lawrence. So being tucked into the woods gives it the advantage of being very quiet. The facility is clean, cool and comfortable. The rooms are... More	4.0

The room was clean and in good condition. Would stay there again. The free breakfast was mostly good except for the biscuits that got staler every day. Made me wonder how often they made the biscuits. Friday they were good, by Monday they were very very stale. The scrambled eggs were good on Friday through Sunday. Monday They tasted different and weren't as good. I ended up having to throw mine away and eating a muffin instead.	4.0

My girlfriends and I stayed here for two nights so that we could see a performance at the Majestic theater.

This hotel has recently had a facelift. My daughter stayed here several years ago, and was very impressed with the update! Quiet, with super comfortable beds. Friendly staff and great breakfast. Easy off and on interstate. Near mall, other shopping district and restaurants. And the price is right!	5.0
Love this hotel. Beautiful lobby and very good restaurants. The coffee in the room was delicious and the maker easy to use-sometimes one must move the coffee maker etc... The best part of the trip is that the hotel is quiet. I couldn't hear other doors in my hallway banging closed.	5.0
We stayed at Club Quarters in December.We were in town for the weekend to see Wicked.Its a very nice hotel in a great location. We were one block off of Michigan Ave and about 5 blocks from the theater district.If you're looking for a high end hotel this is not the hotel for you Yes the rooms are small but how long are you really in your roomThe rooms were clean and thats really most important.When we arrived at 1230pm we were able to check in.We were told we could valet park for 36.00 or for 20.00 we could park for a 24 hour time limit in a parking garage right down the street.We opted for the 20.00 option. MAKE SURE YOU GET A TICKET!!!My husband did not get a ticket at the parking garage and when he inquired about it at the office in the parking garage the girl told him not to worry about it.Well on Sunday morning when he tried to get our car back it was an issue. You have to have a ticket to be able to get your car back. After about 15 minutes the issue was resolved and we got our car back.The entire staff was very helpful including the doorman. He was very helpful in getting us a cab. He ran down at least a block and flagged down a cab, he got in the cab with the driver and came back to the hotel so we could get our cab. It was a very nice thing to do considering the day we were there it was sleeting and raining and everyone in chicago was trying to get a cab at the same time.After reading all the bad reports on his hotel we were debating on switching to a different hotel.We never waited for an elevator, the rooms were clean, the location was great.Im glad we stayed here. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a resonable priced hotel near Michigan Ave.	5.0

I stay here at least once a year for the last 3.

I booked 2 nights. Stayed 1 and got out. I was afraid to shower here. By far the worst place I have ever stayed. My window didn't close all the way. I use the term window loosely.

The Chelsea itself seemed very nice even thought I didn't stay in a room there. As you walk through the Chelsea and into the Annex you get a totally different feel. It goes from semi-upscale to the creepy part of the hotel in American Horror Story. The beat up squeaky elevators to dimly lit hallways and the sketchy bright red lights on every floor it screamed AHS. On the positive side the price was great for a Friday night and it was just a really short walk to the Trop. Next time I would pay the few extra dollars and stay at the regular Chelsea not the Annex.	2.0

We stayed here one night, because it was the end of our family vacation, and we ended up staying too late to leave/drive home. So we got this place cause it was cheapest in the area, and ended up being almost better than the room we had just stayed in for a week. The beds and pillows were so nice and fluffy, the floors were new and nice not dirty. There was a micro, fridge, and coffemaker. The tv was a flat screen. The bathroom was newly redone and very nice. Was happy i didn't have to be scared.	4.0
After doing research for hotels in D.C areas, I found this hotel very attractive in term of price and easy access to metro to D.C. They provide shuttle to the closest metro station, and the metro go directly to D.C downtown which is very helpful for us. However, I recommend to use their shuttle not during the peak hours, especially from 5 to 7pm, otherwise you end up joining a bunch of people waiting for shuttle. The breakfast is surprisingly very good, especially the waffle which is one of the best. My kids and I love it, and I recommend this hotel for family trip.	4.0
I headed to Chicago to celebrate with friends all of our September birthdays and the Central Loop Hotel was amazing. Great location, great service and so comfortable and clean. I would describe it as a New York style room - small but certainly roomy. The beds were amazing, the pillows so soft and fluffy and my entire experience (3 days) was great. The staff was incredibly helpful and found me a room that was ready for an early check-in. I really liked that on each floor at the elevators they had a purified water station and empty, sealed water bottles for the guests use. What a great idea. The attached Elephant Castle was a great spot for a cocktail or breakfast.	5.0

We checked in at 6 pm, 3 hours after check in time of 3pm. Our room wasn't ready and housekeeping staff could be seen standing outside smoking. Granted I was given a 15 discount however, I would have happily paid another 50 per night to not be in that neighborhood. Employees smoking at the door to the lobby, the smell of weed in the hallway, a fight in the parking lot, literally people walking in off the street for the continental breakfast and asking us to use our cell phones, our room was 54 degrees upon entering.... I could go on and on, but won't. Needless to say I would never stay at this hotel or recommend it to anyone. Our friends chose this hotel because it was pet friendly. And they would hang out in our room because theirs reeked. Regardless of how much Lysol of ours they used, it smelled. On a scale of 1-10 it was a 1.	1.0
The staff was very friendly and they made check-in super fast. My family and I got there a little early they checked the room and since it was clean they got us in early. One of the best stays I've had in a hotel. We will definitely be staying here again in the future.	5.0

Bad: Dropped in for advice on a good Japanese restaurant. The concierge seemed perplexed and said he would call or email with info. He never did. In fact there was a great sushi just in front of the hotel. Very strange. When I called the concierge from outside the hotel I was put on hold and left on hold. I could have died on hold. The rooms need a facelift and I have stayed in better for half the price. The restaurant for breakfast is soulless and very expensive and not up to much. Regarding the above you have many comments on TripAdvisor about the same so why not do something about it. Good: Joyce the concierge ( I think that was her name) made up for the others who probably couldn't find Los Angeles on the map. The pool. The location That's it.	3.0

The Best Western Inn at Napa was a very comfortable place to stay. The room was a very decent size and had good amenities. Parking was free and it was in a good location to be able to explore Napa, although admittedly not in the most picturesque part of the valley.

Check in: employee was very pleasant . Check in process took long, although the front desk did the best she could. The issue was that she was all by herself and so many people were checking in.Rooms: excellent,clean and spacious. Bed was very comfortable. Amenities were excellent as well.

The room was clean. The breakfast for good. The pool was nice. Perfect location to downtown savannah and tybee island. Staff was friendly. The only thing I can say negative is that the a/c didn't cool really good but we did stay cool when the sun went down at night. But during the day it was a little warm. Hard to get the room cool.	5.0
This place is great! The service is incredibly friendly and welcoming. The free breakfast is delicious and on weekdays they have fresh baked cookies in the evenings. I come back anytime I'm in Ashland.	5.0
The rooms were very spacious and clean however, very noisy being on the second floor. Kids jumping and running all hours of day and night. Front staff were very helpful and the breakfast was great. Shuttle (ART pay as you go or get a pass at the office) was just outside the door as was Denny's and Starbucks. Not the usual Mariott standard though. Older- small pool. --Hence the 3 star.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your review. I am sorry to hear that we did not live up to your expectations. Please feel free to contact me personally to discuss your stay in more detail so I know how we can turn your three into a five.Hospitably,Greg WilliamsGeneral ManagerGreg.WilliamsMarriott.com714-939-9700	3.0
we were there for a golfing experience , as there are many courses in the area. the front desk team were very friendly, the whole check in process took about 2 minutes off to a very clean comfortable room. during the evening we used the hot tub to relax the area was clean and well maintained. my wife and i...

Overall, the value was good for our purpose which was just a place to sleep. The front desk staff were top notch, going above and beyond to make sure that our room was satisfactory. The kitchenette was useful. The curious stains on the carpet and duvet would make me think twice about staying here again however.	3.0
What a wonderful experience for a girls get away. Chef Dean and Nicole were great hosts. Breakfast was an international, yummy delight. Each room was different and very comfortable. The beds were conducive to a great night's sleep. We will be returning for our annual fall get away. Thanks so much Chef Dean an Nicole.	5.0

I have to say I am never happy when I get out of my car and walk into my room.

First off I'll start with The Saint is an unique boutique hotel that sits on Eaton Street with access to Duval Street. We had booked what they call the petite double I believe and they aren't wrong. My husband paced it out and we figured it was approx 150 square feet. That being said it did have everything you needed and was tastefully done, but you'd never want to stay in it more then a night or two. They had a lovely balcony over looking Duval Street that sadly for us was 1 room away from ours and on NY's Eve they had their party on it . I wish I would have known this in advance as laying in bed after midnight it felt and sounded as if I was still in the middle of the dance floor. That aside I suppose I should have expected that being NY's but I've never been in a hotel especially a Marriott where the party was more important to the guest comfort. They have a lovely bar in the lobby away from the guest rooms which would have been a better and less noisy option for the quests who weren't attending their NYs party. All and all I'd say there are plenty of other choices to stay at in Key West at comparable costs (this wasn't cheap at 448.00 per night for 2 for the smallest room) that would cater more to the comfort of their guests then the 50 dollars a person they made at the NY's party.I apologize for the noise on New Year's Eve. Key West is a hot spot for the holiday and our hotel is known for the balcony countdown party overlooking Duval Street. The rates are comparable to other hotels for that night yet may have not been quieter on this busy day on the island. We hope you will give us another visit on a non-holiday and reserve one of our larger Superior King rooms that will be more comfortable for you. Happy New Year to you and your family.	4.0
Bad: Breakfast can be better. Good: Everthing is perfect!	5.0
Nothing to complain about. Very friendly staff and loved it! Diana and Taylor were very helpful. Breakfast was great. Bacon, eggs, hasbrowns, waffles! It was a wonderful experience. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!	5.0
Might have stayed in a BW a handful of times over the years. It was just never a chain that I ever felt any loyalty to. We were heading to Galveston for a cruise and stopped in Lufkin the night before on the way down. I have to say was a nicer room than I have received at much higher... More	5.0
The hotel seemed old and when I checked into my room there was a dirty rag left on the counter in the bathroom. In addition, there was mold around the handicap bar at the end where it meets the wall. When I checked in the hotel they could not find my HH.	3.0
This little hotel lived up to my expectations of a JDV hotel (I've stayed at Shoreline previously and loved it)! I have to speak of the staff first because they were all spectacular - could not fault a single person! As a loner tourist, it makes a difference to have super friendly, efficient and helpful staff. In regards to location,... More	4.0

I find that Candlewood Suites offers an excellent stay for the price. It is better much than a lot of more expensive hotels. The hotel is always very clean. It offers the best in creature comforts and each room is very well organized for business travel.	5.0
Location, cleanliness, service great! Loved the pool and spa! Only problem was an extra charge on my debit card that they did not tell me about, will call and straighten it out tomorrow!	5.0
The resort and staff are wonderful. The hotel is very nice and the groups are beautiful. The location is secluded so you need a rental car or to book the house car in advance. The concierge staff has not been to most of the spots so use trip advisor to help find the right places.	5.0
The room is small and when we added a cot, it was almost too small. The important things, like air conditioner, tv package, internet, etc...were all sufficient.

It rocked. Went for a two day concert, so many fellow showmates stayed at the hotel. The pool area was transformed into a pre-game party with food and tunes. The hotel and staff were outstanding. The only drawback was that it would have been nice if the hotel shuttle operated on the weekend.	5.0
Booked this hotel as our first stop on our USA roadtrip based on budget so didnt have any expectations on arrival.

Other than the staff, this was the worst hotel experiences I and my traveling companions have ever had. Per the hotel manager there was an ant infestation they had resolved, they had not. Both my sister and I received several bug bites. Hoterl staff was nonesistent. We came back after being out and the one trash can was empied but sittting in the living area, the toilet paper had not been stocked and towels were left on top of our luggage as opposed to hung in the appropriate area, the toilet overflowed the first time we used it. And finally and most disgusting was that a used condom was ound in one of the nightstands (ewww). Now on to the facilities. The levator was out of order one night, unruly and unsupervised children were left to run roughshod over the pool area. We were subjected to splashes in our face, yelling and our belongings being knocked over (staff did not come to check even though everal adults complained). We spent a total of a half hour of our 3 day stay in the whirlppl finally giving up to sit on the sun deck in order to have some peace and quiet. Only issue with staff was when my sister went to the fornt desk to ask for a hand towel so that she could wipe the sweat of her face(August in Virgina is hot as Hades) and the desk personnel told her that they did not have any and gave her a bat mat instead. To reiterate, the entire experience beyond the pleasant staff was horrific... DO NOT STAY HERE!!!	1.0
The bed was comfy staff were very friendly. The Hotel appears to be fairly new, so it's very clean well kept. It's right off a pretty busy street, so there was quite a bit of road noise at night. Ask for a room away from the road if you can.	3.0
this is a fantastic hotel, i think it is a hidden gem located in the arts district of Phoenix. It is a fairly new hotel, very different, in a good way, from your typical hotel. The grounds are spotless, plenty of fun places to eat all within walking distance. I would not say it is within walking distance in the middle of summer in Phoenix to Chase Field or Talking Stick Arena. But the light rail has a stop right in front of the hotel and with your game ticket it is a free ride or for 4 bucks per person you can ride the light rail anywhere all day. Valet parking, only option, is 25 per day but they were great. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Rooms are the best part, very industrial but super cool. Concrete floors with plenty of area rugs.Neat shower and here would be the only complaints. The room is very open, the bath room only has frosted glass between the bathroom and rest of the room. Light from the bath room floods the rest of the room, especially on night runs to the bathroom. And has at least one other has said, you hear ALL noises coming from the bathroom which can be embaressing. We were in room 709, top floor king room with balcony and had an inflatable bed which I slept on (25 per night) It was a south facing room and had a great view of the city. 100 percent recommend this hotel, plenty of art all around. Just a fun place, the hotel is a destination, just like a Disney HotelThank you so much! We're so happy to hear you had such a wonderful stay. Hope to see you again soon.	5.0
The Hotel was very clean hospitable. The entire staff was very couteous and prompt in responses to my needs during my stay. I would like to suggest that this particular Hotel whose location is right on the oceanfront, perhaps offer specials or services geared more towards romantic getaways.	5.0

The hotel suited my purposes. Staff were helpful. Last 2 nights had no hot water. Sink light stopped working 5 days into trip. The price was good. Room was as clean as it could be.

Besides the rude customer service, overall it was great. The rooms are spacious and we had no problems at all. Everything worked well. The water park passes to Noah's Ark and Chula VIsta is a plus.

This unassuming hotel is well located for sightseeing, restaurants and views of the Chicago River and the river walk. The rooms are comfortable with basic amenities and free wi-fi but best suited for one person. A guest lounge on the second floor offers a large lobby, TV, computer terminals and an array of snacks, fruit, beverages. The highest praise is reserved for the front desk staff - Ramon and Diego were friendly and competent making restaurant suggestions that were delicious (Benny's Chop House).Dear Jeri G, thank you for taking the time to write a review and especially the kind words you had for Roman, Diego and the staff. There is nothing we love more than being able to share wonderful comments like yours with the staff and we will be sure the team sees it.

The room was clean when we arrived and housekeeping came every morning to clean and verify all was well and if we needed any additional towels, toiletries etc. Their breakfast area was clean, the food was hot and fresh and there was plenty food to go around. I read some guests didn't like the breakfast voucher system but my husband and I liked them because we have stayed at other hotels where there is more people in the breakfast area than there is food. Their Wifi went down while at their business center, they informed me that the system was running slow and that their service provider was on property trying to fix it. I let them know that I was in the middle of a Disney ticket purchase and the front desk staff immediately got their own personal Hotspot set up on their front desk computer. They let me finish my Disney ticket purchase/transaction from their desk....yes from their desk... which i didn't expect. I was really happy cause that saved us alot of time and hassle. The hotel is close to WDW and plenty of dinning.

Would HIGHLY recommend.	5.0

My wife and I very much enjoyed our stay for a quick Baltimore weekend getaway. The hotel is small but the rooms are big. There were a lot of mirrors, and the kitchenette allowed for a second sink and counter top to get ready. We were on the second floor, so the noise from the street was pretty loud, but not to the point where it kept either of us up all night. The breakfast is a pseudo-hot breakfast... no eggs or meat but it did have a waffle maker. Location is perfect, but at night it gets loud and rowdy, and there was some police activity just a block down (nothing bad, just drunken party goers). I would definitely stay here again.	5.0

We visited the Sanibel Inn whilst on holiday in Naples as we'd spent a day on the Island the year before. The Inn was in a great location.

This was a very clean nice place to stay and it is very close to the grand ole opry as well as downtown Nashville. I would recomend staying here if you do not mind a short drive to downtown and an easy cab ride to Opryland. There are several nice places to eat in the area as well.	4.0
Great location with lots to do. The staff and service were A+. Facilities were very accommodating with BBQ's, fire pits, and several areas to just relax. Beach is accessible, although the stairs a slightly steep. We will definitely go back!	5.0

This hotel is just two block to Bourbon Street and close enough to walk alway to Cafe DuMonde. Safe area. Bed very comfortable and hotel perfectly clean and nice.

I had a very nice stay at the Virginian Suites. They are remodeling the hotel, and you can really tell by the quality of the room. It was very modern, clean, and comfortable. My only complaints are thus- the hotel is extremely difficult to find. I suppose that's not the hotel's fault, it is a very confusing area of town anyways. Also, I was not aware that I would have to pay 7 extra dollars for parking. Just wish I would have been aware of this ahead of time. I would, however, stay there again.	4.0
We were on the road, and booked this right before midnight. Really the only hotel available at that time. Quaint hotel in an adorable town, but we had a truck with 18 foot trailer - no parking! We parked 3 blocks away on the street! No problems! The hotel has a few bars and there was defiantly some parting going on, but you could not hear it from our room! Hotel had elevator, but was not working at that time and we had to climb one big set of steps! Room was clean but 'old' and charming! Think we had a 'spirit' that messed with my night lite, but was 'friendly'! Nice breakfast in the AM - coffee was amazing! Food was nicely prepared and fresh! Desk clerk at midnight was very nice and accommodating (forgot his name!) sorry! Would love to come back to 'explore' this town and would defiantly stay here again!	5.0
I had just booked a 4 week stay at the hotel starting from mid July and thought I would give this place a try having never stayed or tried this hotel brand.

Looks like a higher priced, well appointed hotel room. Clean, roomy, and modern. Walking distance to the Outback Steakhouse. Wireless internet was fast. Nice breakfast. Room was quiet. I would recommend this, especially to business travellers.	5.0

We spent several nights at this hotel. We loved the location about 8 miles away from the strip, but easy drive. You do need a car if you stay at this property. It is far from most everything else. Plenty of places to eat in the area. Located in a beautiful place near golf course. We had a nice view of the mountains and Las Vegas strip. We found it quiet at night, even though we were there over a weekend, and there were families with young children staying at the hotel. The hotel staff was very friendly, and helpful. We found our room to be large, and clean. Bathroom was large and had double vanity. It is not the most fancy of rooms, but it had everything we needed. A fridge, coffee maker, flat screen TV. We ate at a couple of the restaurants in the hotel and they were good, the buffet breakfast was very good variety for the money. We saw a show at the showroom, every seat is a good one. We used the pool which was very nice, not the biggest one but nicely decorated and plenty of seats. Overall very happy and would stay again.	5.0
Housekeeping left my door unlocked, and at the end of my stay the staff charged the wrong credit card. The people were pleasant, but if I had a choice between brusque staff who did their jobs properly and pleasant people who did not, I'd take brusque.Paul M,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

I booked 2 rooms online and made special requests directly to the hotel, all of which were met without any problems. I had some additional requests on our arrival again all were met with great attitudes by the hotel employees. The staff was always pleasant and helpful. Though it is close to the highway, our rooms were in the front and below highway level, so noise was not at all a problem. The free breakfast is great, offering freshly baked waffles, scrambled eggs, and fresh fruit, as well as the usual. Shuttle was always available during our stay and took us to restaurants as well as the Metro. We will definitely return when we visit the DC area again.	5.0
Bad: The prices of the SPA treatment are quite expensive. If you go to most expensive SPA in Dubai the treatment can varies between USD 120 for normal facial cleansing up to USD 500 or 600 for a full package of 4 hours . Yet here the minimum starts at USD 280/- excluding the taxes ! . Good: What not to like about this property !!! Everything was great. The location, the spacious rooms the view the room service the in room dining the restaurants even the Spa. Ok I didn't try the spa due to my busy schedule but it looked so good (although the prices of the treatments were quite expensive). Some people thing that the hotel is a bit expensive, well it is located in one of the most prestigious and expensive districts in LA. It is just located on the famous Rodeo Drive. The rooms were big. I advise you to not take the room with balconies if you know your self won't use it. The balcony takes space out of the room. My most concerns and worries normally in any hotel is the cleanness of the bathroom and toilets and here it was just perfect.	5.0
3-block walk to the inner harbor. Staff was excellent - front desk manager carried bags to my room for me since there were no luggage carts available... Will stay again if I visit Baltimore again!	5.0

We stayed one night while on a road trip to Chicago. If we ever pass through Fort Collins again, we will definitely be staying at this hotel.

We checked in very late to the hotel and asked if we could check out at 1 pm instead of noon and they said it was fine. I put the do not disturb sign on the door just to have the cleaning staff disregard it. They knocked twice at about 9:30 waking up my husband, and then proceeded to try opening the door. Since I had the lock on, they realized we were not ready for them to clean. They came back a second time an hour later and did the same thing. This time since my husband had woken up, I yelled out we're not ready! Do not disturb means do not disturb. I called the front desk and they said that they would talk to the cleaning manager. As we were getting ready, they knocked again and again. To say the least we ended up not sleeping well at all. This is unacceptable! What's the point of offering a sign that's going to be disregarded. I hope no one else has a similar experience.	3.0
Was nice location from the long drive from Nutley, NJ to Washington DC. The shower and bathroom facilities is very good. The room is spacious and well lit. The front lights and bathrooms lights were remarkable since it has motion detectors and switches on and off automatically. Overall the stay was welcoming for well traveled guests.	4.0
Very clean, relatively new hotel. Flat-screen tv's in rooms and great restaurant on ground level. Highly recommended for business travelers. If you are looking to really enjoy Baltimore and relax, this may not be the hotel for you. You will end up spending a lot of for cab rides.	5.0
This was one of the most memorable hotels I've stayed at from it's eclectic and fun vibe to the gracious and friendly staff. We were greeted by Angel who was top notch at explaining the hotel re-image as well as was incredibly thorough on explaining the room we reserved, it's accommodations and the awesome tablet that is a connection has everything you'll need from room service to tourist information. I will be coming to Phoenix more often in the coming years and this hotel will be where I will be staying. The room was clean and gorgeous. We were taking pictures for the first few minutes of arriving because the set-up was so appealing and balcony view of downtown Phoenix was breathtaking. We stayed in the balcony king suite and for the price-point it was such a great value. I will be recommending this hotel to anyone visiting central Arizona. Thank you to the staff and management for making a quick one night trip so much fun. You all did a superb job at conveying what your ideology for a great hotel is. P.S. The amount of charging/usb charging ports you have around the room make a techy like me giddy. James! Thank you for making out day! We're so happy to hear you loved the hotel and enjoyed your stay. We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with us. We do hope you will come back and visit us again soon.	5.0

We had to stay here for a long period of time. When we first arrived we got there 4 hours before normal check in and they allowed us to get a room!

Everything positive you've read about this hotel in the Trip Advisor reviews is spot on. I originally considered the Ocean Tower precisely because TripAdvisor had it rated so highly, and my wife was adamant that we should stay in Waikiki. Normally, getting around Waikiki is painful in a car because of the traffic, but since this hotel sits at the end of the strip, it is really easy to get to from the H1 by taking the King Street Exit. Anyway, the hotel is smaller than many I've stayed in, but that (and the incredible customer service!) gives it a very intimate feel. The rooms are good sized and are seemingly soundproof, which I really appreciated. The hotel is literally a block from the beach. The parking lot is small, but they immediately gave us the option to park around the corner at the large garage of a different hotel and that ended up being a less expensive option as well.The staff was wonderful, in particular Leonore and Terry. They really took great care of us (and I have to say it's nice when the managers call you by name everytime they see you). It was my birthday while we were there, and even though they sent some treats up to the room each day, on my birthday they sent champagne and glasses.We also got to tour the rooms that are being renovated, and I can't wait to go back once that is complete in the November timeframe. The new rooms have an ultra-modern, San Francisco/ Asian theme to them, and have all the amenities one could ask for, especially if you are a technogeek like me.Overall, I was incredibly impressed with the hotel and will stay here anytime I have business or vacation in Honolulu.	5.0

I read the earlier reviews about the mold smell, but we were here many decades ago, so decided to persist in our nostalgia.

The price was right and the location can't be beat. The hotel lobby and room were spotless and the staff could not have been more helpful. The gym was also very clean and the equipment was state of the art. Will definitely become a repeat customer at this hotel. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the sink leaked onto the floor creating a very minor nuisance. Highly recommended, though!	4.0

I recently stayed at the Suncoast for three nights while working on a project in Las Vegas. The good points about this property are that it has plenty of parking (due to the casino), large rooms, great views from the back of the building, and good housekeeping service. The beds were fairly comfortable (but firm) but the pillows were very hard. Walking into the property however, is like a journey back in time. The decor is dated (brass fixtures everywhere) and the casino, registration, and dining areas are like standing in a chimney. There are so many people smoking in the casino, with so little ventilation, that the smell permeates almost the entire property. After a few minutes, my eyes were burning. Fortunately, the smell did not extend to the rooms (but it did to the hallways). Other negative aspects of the property are the very poor selection of TV channels and the poor set ups for working in the rooms. There is wireless internet but there are no power outlets near the desk or bedside tables. It is obvious that this property survives based on its clientele of older casino patrons. I would stay away unless I had a specific reason to be in this area.	3.0

Just a quick one night stop over for our family. But the beds were very comfortable, and the hotel in general felt recently renovated and nice. The staff was very friendly. There was more noise than I'm used to at hotels from people walking around in the room above us and people slamming the doors in the hallway early in the morning. Some minor things that didn't bother us in this one night stayover, but maybe in a longer stay, we were missing a microwave in our room and either a large picture or mirror on the wall as there were metal picture hanging brackets and nothing on them.	4.0

Bad: I was overcharged at the property and after two requests to front desks no one got back to me. The third time I went to follow up myself. They overcharged me 130 dollars for the room. The hotel was under renovation so it was not good being on a partial construction site with the sound of drills going off. I would advise to shop around on the strip. Good: Bed was comfortable	3.0

Every night when we came back to the hotel, numerous spots were open. We were delighted. Until we figured out why. It appears that someone designing the spaces are attempting to put as many as possible there, so the spots are very narrow. Even in a midsize car, you cannot park in many of the spots, because someone has parked over the lines, because the spaces are too small. It's like a domino effect. So you can't park unless you want someone dinging your car door. Because of this, we had to find parking very far away from our room. The hotel is very convenient and away from down town. The Old Town Shuttle is a good idea, but it runs only once and hour. It's always packed because of this and the fact that it services four hotels. It was a waste of 20. The rooms were clean, the pool was hot as a sauna, and the breakfast was okay. We would stay again.Dear Phillip H,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. Unfortunately Parking on this Island is a hot commodity, but I must agree that some of the spaces do seem narrow. We are also continuing to work on how we can make our shuttle better. I will be share you comments to our team so that we can try to make the correct adjustments. Please feel free to contact my Directly if there is anything that I can do in the future.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manger	3.0
My wife and I celebrated our 20th anniversary at the Grand Hyatt. We stayed here for our honeymoon, and it was just as good, if not better two decades later. The location is beautiful, the rooms are attractive and well kept, and the service is excellent. I recommend it 100.	5.0

My experience checking in and out was terrible. Service appeared Lethargic, uninterested and uninvested. I would have gone elsewhere had it not been pouring down rain.

The hotel is a good pick when the goal is to have a place to crash that is cheaper than the majority in the area and when you want something clean. I did appreciate the shuttle to and from the metro that was provided for free. The hotel doesn't have a lot of extras but it fit the bill for us.	4.0

We were given rooms at this hotel on Hotwire. The location was great and the staff was very helpful and friendly, but our room and bathroom/shower were very small and the bed was hard as a rock. It seems standard these days that 1-bed rooms will be outfitted with a King bed and 2-bed rooms with 2 Queens or at least Doubles. Our room had a Queen bed which took up most of the room and my mom and brother's room had 2 Twins!

We have traveled to all areas of the US and realize high tourist areas such as this are normally higher priced lodging. However, when you pay a higher price for a hotel you expect the establishment to provide an equal value for your dollars. Not the case here. The front desk staff, both in the early evening and in the morning, have very poor customer service skills. We felt we were disturbing them any time we approached them. Also, the walkways and exterior areas have not been cleaned in months. The breakfast was bad! Never again!Dear Don G,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We take all of our reviews seriously so we can better serve our Guests. Reading through your review I see the we fell short of your expectations. I apologize for the service that was provided.

A typical Hampton Inn. Two issues, however. Located at an exit that has no town around it...just 2 other motels restaurants, gas, etc. 1or 2 exits.

3 stars is a bit over what I would call this hotel. The rooms are old and the walls are thin.

Nice and clean. Decent sized TV that you can rent movies, N64 games, go online, or listen to music. Not much closet space, only get one dresser, but plenty of hanging room. Nice bathroom. Bed was comfortable, but pillows were a little stiff. Kitchen was large enough. Full sized refrigerator with freezer. They have some pots and a pan, and a broiler pan, but no cookie sheets. Plenty of utensils and glasses, and a few things like serving spoons. There's a dish washer, and they give you the detergent. Good microwave, and cabinet space. The oven wasn't the best, but good enough. Take advantage of kitchen, stuff down here is expensive. Friendly staff that was multi-lingual, but spoke English very well. I think their website said olympic sized swimming pool, but the pool was not Olympic sized. There was a lifeguard on duty, but he did not double as a pool boy so there was a good bit of leaves and stuff floating around. Overall I was very happy with the hotel and would definitely stay here again.	4.0
While making coffee one morning and trying to iron a shirt, the circuit tripped. The sad part was that the GFI was at the END of the electrical run, not the beginning, so I had to call down to the front desk and wait for someone to reset the circuit at the electrical panel. I shouldn't have blown in the first place, but it also should be re-wired properly.	3.0
Great little hotel. Front desk staff was great with recommendations to nearby restaurants etc. Noise was not bad at all. Had a room with an outside view.

If you want to experience the perfect city hotel in New York with everything from service, location and friendliness this is perfect.We spend Christmas here and it was amazing. The room was very nice, quiet and with a fantastic bed and everything. The service at the reception was very good and also during the rest of the stay.The butler service was also very good. We will definitely come back. The only thing that can be improved are the lights at breakfast, it was to bright so you missed a little bit of the coziness.Dear Andrew18985,Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The St. Regis New York.

Terribly managed hotel. Probably the worst hotel I have stayed in a while. Arrived late in the evening and found a que of guests trying to check in. One family with four kids apparently had booked two rooms via Expedia only to be told they had only one room with a king bed available. The two guys behind the counter had no clue what to do - listening to their phone conversation with (apparently) their manager, it seems they had a number of free rooms - but those had not been cleaned and where dirty. They also made everyone pay a 200 security fee - which upset several of the guests trying to check in. My room was prepaid and I did not have that problem. However, I needed to go three times up to my room on the 6th floor because the key card did not work - they then switched me to another room. The door of the first room had clear signs of an attempted break in. Since they could give me another room, why did they not give another one for this family Room was ok but smelled moldy. Breakfast was poor and breakfast room pretty dirty and unpleasant. To sum it up, I do not recommend this hotel. Should have chosen the Courtyard Marriott across the street instead - eventhoug it is a little more expensive. Other folks in my group stayed there - I should have done the same.	2.0

Bad: There is no longer a casino, and the pool is seasonal despite it easily being warm enough to be used. The sauna was also out of action.

We stayed just one night on our way back to NJ from the University of Maryland, and decided to take the evening in Baltimore. The Embassy Suites is always a nice stay for us, particularly with the buffet breakfast. Hotel lodging and comfort were great, and the price was more affordable than staying right at the Inner Harbor. Rooms were comfortable and spacious, and the ground and interiors were classy. Would definitely stay there again for a Baltimore vacation. As you would imagine, this hotel is geared towards airport travelers and executives, and a shuttle runs continuously between the airport and hotel. I would suggest having a shuttle also running to the Inner Harbor, which would broaden the hotel's base of travelers by offering an easy way into the Harbor (and avoiding having to take the Light Rail service). Otherwise, everything was great.	4.0

Overall very pleased with hotel. Though there technically was plenty of space, the porta-crib barely fit between the beds. Room was very clean. Liked having the fridge. Bathroom clean. Wifi worked well. Good selection of tv channels, though we didn't watch it too often. Maid did go in one day while we were out despite the do not disturb sign being on door, which makes me uncomfortable, but it was all good. Breakfast was nice in having many choices.

This hotel is less than a mile from DuPont so I decided to stay here.I am a smoker and when I found out that the hotel was smoke free I started to find another hotel to stay at.The hotel was clean and the room was rather nice but I am more apt to stay else where that has smoking.	4.0
I was a little worried by some of the reviews I read that stated the staff was rude and the hotel was in disrepair but the price was amazing so we went ahead and booked....and I'm SO GLAD WE DID!! The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful (and I'm from the South, so I know friendly.) The hotel has normal wear and tear, but was very clean and nicely furnished. Some people may not like that the microwave and fridge are extra (would have been nice to have but we wouldn't have used either so it didn't bother us). Beds are very comfortable and rooms are large enough to lounge in the evenings after a long day. The free shuttle service was great. The Metro (subway) is farther away than listed. The site stated 1/4 mi, but it's closer to 3/4 or 1mi. We had no problem walking it during the day. If this is your first visit, be sure to ask specifically where the shuttle will pick up. We were on the wrong side and missed it the first time. If you exit the Metro up the escalators, go out and to the left up the steps to where there are several bus stops. If you exit to the right near the greyhound stop (and a several story parking garage), you're on the wrong side. The shuttle drivers were very nice and happy to give directions and tips. Once you're on the Metro, a 20min ride gets you into the city. Definitely worth it to save hundreds on a hotel room. There are several restaurants right outside the hotel and several more within 1/4-1/2mi walk. There are also some smaller shopping places if you forget any necessities. We would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely return if we're ever back in the DC area.	5.0

Intially, I thought this would be a great place to stay. The Customer Sevice and facility was clean. However, the rooms are extra small and not much room to move around. There is no refrigerator or microwave. Everything is cramped in the room. The TV was a LG but the remote control barely worked. Also, we did have towels but... More	2.0
What can I say but there is no other choice when staying in the area. Kristi made the stay happen before even checking in. A simple call and boom, a better room.

The accommodations at the Hampton Inn and Suites were pleasant, but the hotel staff is amazing, friendly, and willing to ensure your stay is memorable. Everyone from the maid service to the front desk and general managers helped make the prolonged stay in the Fort Lewis, WA area as great experience as possible.	5.0
Don't know how this place has some many high reviews. The rooms were not well maintained or cleaned. The management photos are very misleading. See my attached room photos of what you really get. Sticky wet floors, sticky walls in the bathroom, thick layers of dust, blood or burn stains on the sheets, AC from the 80's that barely ran,... More	2.0
So there is nothing wrong with this hotel. It is average and what you would expect of Holiday Inn Express. I am glad that we got the reservations on Hotels.com. The rooms were conveniently priced and I thought the services of the hotel were fine for the price I had paid. However, when we inquired about staying an extra day the room cost twice as much. I understand that getting reservations early and using a service like hotels.com is much cheaper but I could not see paying twice as much money for such a mediocre hotel.	4.0
Bad: The complimentary breakfast was not good at all. Kinda a joke. Very disappointing. For the money we spent for the room we expected a bit more. Good: Staff was nice and helpful. Room was clean and somewhat nice.	4.0
The front desk staff was very helpful, called a cab and helped with questions. The shuttle to/from the airport was good. The hotel was very cramped in all ways including the rooms. Had to pay for just about everything including printing and even coffee. Walls were thin. Location was pretty ugly, looking out on a yard full of parked buses.... More	3.0

I stayed at the Ocean Tower Hotel for a week in early May based on positive reviews from TripAdvisor. These reviews were completely fair. This was an affordable hotel, located footsteps to Waikiki Beach. The rooms were clean and quiet the staff were friendly and accommodating. True, the hallways have tired carpet and the walls could do with some fresh wallpaper. But who cares about these trifles This was a great hotel. (However, if you are watching your weight, give the continental breakfast -- peanut-and-jelly on toast, danishes and donuts -- a wide berth. Fortunately, the rooms come with mini-fridges so you can store some healthier options which you can purchase at one of the many ubiquitous 'ABC' convenience stores.)	4.0
I cannot say enough about this outstanding hotel. Everything was top notch! The valets and front desk went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable, easy and memorable! La Jolla is so beautiful and upon our return we will only stay at this amazing property!	5.0
The Mills House is a very old hotel in Charleston that has been nicely updated to the modern age. It is really close to just about everything. If you can stay here during the week it is actually pretty reasonable but it gets really expensive on weekends. Except for the cost however we found little to complain about. The staff is very attentive and the rooms are comfortable and quiet. My only complaint was that the breakfast, though good, was nothing special.	4.0
We were traveling from Kansas City to Big Sky and had laid out our itinerary to include a stop at Broadus.

Was really excited to stay in a historical hotel. Got in very late and requested a very quite room. Was informed that there would be no one at the front desk after 11:00. Got in my room and settled in, noticed toothpaste in the sink, hair on the floor and in the tub but of course by this time there was no one at the front desk..Turned the TV off and went to bed but the music from the nightclub kept me awake until they closed at 2:am. I will never stay there again! Very disappointed!!	2.0
Everything was great!! We will definitely stay here the next time we come to Grove City!!	5.0
Nice location, nice front desk service.	4.0
This hotel is perfect for a short stay. It's really close to the interstate, they have a pool, there's ample parking and eateries close by (you could walk) to get a quick bite to eat. They offer breakfast in the lobby from 6am-9am, however, I was not able to take advantage. They offer free wifi, but found it a bit... More	3.0
This hotel is ok if you need a short stay, mostly for sleeping. I stayed two nights, using the swimming pool once. Cons: The breakfast buffet was of mediocre quality (worst is the pastry, tasteless and more like stale bread) The lobby was hot and humid, and could have been cleaner and neater The path to the swimming pool was horrible, filthy, flooded The pool itself is ok, warm, its floor littered with stuff - there is no change room or shower in the pool area Pros WiFi was of good quality, fast and no issue with login or usage Staff were friendly, helpful The bedroom and the bathroom were clean and neat The fridge and all lighting worked well	3.0
My experience here was pretty Awesome! The staff was very Helpful with whatever I needed and any questions I had about the area! I Would Recommend This place over and over! Very Happy with Staying here!!	5.0

Bad: The bar is a little on the expensive side. Drinks are very small for the price. The bartender we had was very slow and not very friendly. We waited about 10 minutes before we were served. It wasn't busy either. Good: Staff was very nice and helpful. The location of the hotel is very convenient.	5.0
Easy to park our car outside the hotel. The receptionist very warm and friendly. The foyer very clean and welcoming. The corridor to our room also clean and well decorated.

Stayed for conference at the JW Marriott. It was a great location and easily within walking distance to my conference. It might have been closer than some of the rooms located within JW. This hotel served breakfast and had a better price on parking. Overall a great stay and I would recommend and stay again.	5.0

Currently here with my husband. It's a clean hotel with a great view. Room 303 looks right out over the water. TV didn't come with a remote but that was rectified quickly. Good place to chill out away from it all. I'll come back.	4.0
Bad: Valet parking was a little pricey.	4.0
We walked in at midnight with no reservation after a stressful day and were so happy to be received by a very nice young women who completely took care of us. The room was nice with a lot of space, and everything looked brand new. Also the bed is crazy comfortable. I would def. stay here again.	5.0
Our room was handicapped accessible yet was located in the most obscure corner of the building on the third floor as far from the elevators as one could get. Seems kind of strange. Check-in process was fast and smooth with no issues room was clean comfortable and everything we needed.	5.0
The shuttle to Bricktown is very convenient. Really good breakfast.	4.0
Clean hotel but the noise and vibrations from people walking outside to the bathroom fans in other rooms reverberated right through the bed. very poor insulation. Definitely not worth 140 a night. Napa city is highly over rated. If you are going for wine, then stay in the small towns up the valley like St Helena.Thank you for your review. I am sorry for any noise you encountered during your stay with us. I will look into the fan noise and get it replaced at once.	2.0

As other reviewers have noted, this is a hotel that had it heyday in years past but for the price it is still comfortable and will give you a good nights sleep.

It was a pleasure and we hope to see you again soon. Sincerely, Liz Lionberger General Manager	5.0
Nice hotel with Outdoor pool. No complementary coffee and bar closes early to get one there. A bit complicated with the billing process, but willing to solve it and did it as promised. Rooms have plenty of room. Limited selection of TV channels.	3.0
We stayed in double queen. It was very spacious. The neighborhood was great. Felt very comfortable there. It's a nonresidential area by the freeway with restaurants nearby. The freeway was a little loud in the mornings and there was some construction going on right outside the hotel. They should be done with the construction there in about a week. It woke us up very early one morning. I told the manager about it and he was happy to switch our rooms if we wanted. We chose to stay in the same room. It was less noisy the next morning without the jackhammer going. The kids even enjoyed watching the big excavator going. The even numbered rooms may be less noisy. Breakfast was decent. Scrambled eggs, sausage, potatoes, waffles, cereal, and donuts. The indoor pool is small. It would maybe fit 15-20 people. There were 12 people when we went and was already getting crowded. Exercise room has an elliptical and recumbent bike only. The staff were very nice. We would stay there again.	5.0
Our softball team stayed here for a tournament in Duquoin. This is just an average hotel. The bedding is badly in need of updating. The bedding had holes in them! Breakfast was ok.

Bad: Me and my husband came to Chicago for our 10 year wedding aniversary. My 10 year anyversary gift from my husband,a watch, was STOLEN from our room while it was being cleaned the day before we left Chicago.The head housekeeper claimd she talked to the person that cleaned our room,but said they didnt see any watch and told me I must have misplaced it, putting the robery on me!!We turned the room up side down,but of course there was NO WATCH!!Nobody offered to call the police,but we were told we could GO TO THE police station and file the paperwork.For two tourists in a country they have never been to before just a few days after the shooting that killed captain Paul Bauer, we didnt even know how to begin to talk to the police.We didnt get any compensation,but the head housekeeper offered us a drink at the bar..... finding out when we came back home that we were charged for the drink.

Arriving on a late flight, our room was ready and clean...on both visits the front desk manager was helpful and courteous.

Just stayed here for the Who concert and also for the Paul McCartney concert in April 2016. Both at the Key Arena: easy walking distance. Nice thing is that Francisco at the front desk remembered me when I checked in this time! Or better yet, he'd gotten my request for connecting rooms and already blocked them for me! That's pretty good service, I reckon.	5.0

From check in through check out, EVERYTHING about this hotel was amazing!! The facilities and rooms were better than the internet pictures......

I will definitely be staying here.	5.0
Nice property, but very crowded. Could improve on pool management. Also wait staff very slow at the pool bar. The food quality and selection at the various restaurants was great. Pool areas are very nice, but management of the area has a lot to be desired. All chairs claimed by 8 am!	4.0

The property is great, and the poker room is the best in Vegas. I've rated the Aria as excellent overall. Since no place is perfect, these comments will address only the imperfections.

We chose Holiday Inn Express- Ashley River, because the rate was considerably lower than the hotels in the center of the historic district. While our choice meant we could not walk to the historic area, the free shuttle worked out well for us. The location was convenient for our visit (driving our own car) to the Magnolia Plantation and a dinner in Mount Pleasant. The hotel was was clean and our breakfast was great. Parking is free ... A bonus. Staff was friendly.	4.0
This Best Western is located on the beach. Some cons are: the parking in front of the hotel is quite tight and spaces limited and the pool is located across the street (there is also a parking garage across the street.) This hotel is located where you can walk to some restaurants and beach shops but it's also a bit away from the heart of things as well. The free continental breakfast was adequate, had hot cold choices, a couple fruit juices, coffee, milk and some fresh apples and oranges to offer. The hotel staff was amazingly nice and accommodating, going above and beyond --in my opinion. This isn't the newest of hotels with aging decor and a semi-cold fridge in my room, but the price and location were perfect for this trip!	3.0
We stayed in a 4 bedroom condo with spectacular ocean views! The resort was clean and very welcoming!

Location not as convenient as originally thought.  Still had to drive to dinner.  Pool is fairly small and seems a long hike from most rooms.  Very nice lobby, only two clerks for check in at 5:00 on a Saturday.  In the future I'll stay downtown or somewhere else.  Disappointed that Wi-Fi and parking were so expensive.  The parking garage two blocks away was free though.	2.0
Good: Morning coffee was excellent and offered on every floor with some delicious pastries The bed and pillows were comfortable and the hotel was very clean. As a past Chicago resident and frequent visitor, I'd definitely stay here again.	5.0

Our experiences with the staff at the hotel were great, everyone was very friendly. The room itself was okay. Nothing very exciting, but it had what we needed. It felt a bit worn out. There was a crack in the shower wall. The safe in the room was quite hard to open because the lock itself was worn. The door to the balcony was hard to lock unlock for the same reason, the AC was very loud, but it did keep us nice cool. The pillows on the bed were strange, instead of your normal sized pillows they were all about the size of a couch throw pillow (about 4-5 on a bed) they were very thick roundish. Too hard on the neck! The location was terrific though it was nice to have a free breakfast every morning. The breakfast bar included juices, tea, coffee milk. There was cereal, French toast, grits, sausage, eggs, pastries, fruit, yogurt, toast, English muffins, etc. You won't go away hungry:) The indoor pool was like a sauna. A bit too warm for us. The outdoor pool is very nice just across the room. There is parking right in front of the hotel or across the street in back of the outdoor pool. It is in walking distance of shops restaurants. It's also about an hour away from Busch Gardens. There is a great ice cream place right across from the hotel called 'Sweet Frog'. Awesome, but a bit on the expensive side. A great treat though. The best thing is the beach so it is well worth it to get an Oceanside balcony.	3.0

Room is a little bit spendy at close to 200/night but it's a nice big room with a desk and a couch. Looks like a junior suite but it doesn't have the 2nd TV in front of the couch.

Bad: Tempeture control. Fan was not automatic. Had to manually turn off and on. not a deal breaker. Good: Location and staff. Staff was very friendly and helpfull. We arrived a few hours before check in and they held our luggage while we explored the area. Lots of shopping an dinner choices close by. T was 2 minutes away. Room was nice.	4.0
The hotel looked like it was in good condition, after entering my room, I noticed that everything in the living room and kitchen was a bit slanted which didn't really bother me. The floor was sloped causing everything to be slant, an obvious foundation issue or very poor construction. While I was in the bedroom, I heard voices and thought someone had entered into the suite, turns out it was people talking in the hallway and because of the slope, there was a 2 inch+ gap between the door and the floor. I was only staying at the hotel for 8 hours, so I didn't ask for a room change, but beware of what room you get.	2.0
To date, this takes the prize. It did not overwhelm me but I was, over the four days I stayed, consistently well served and impressed at the degree of detail that was maintained in every aspect of the experience.

While you can always look hard enough to find something wrong with a hotel, the Omni for our two nights there was excellent.

The Embassy Suites Lithicum provided a high quality venue for our youth baseball team as we participated in a tournament that weekend. The team loved the atmosphere and ambiance of this Hilton brand hotel. It is among the nicer hotels that we now stay in due to an experience that we had with the standard accomodations at popular hotel chains such as DI, M6, S8, HJ, etc. The cook to order breakfast was a bonus. My only complaint would be is that it is a loud hotel on the weekend with special events and people constantly hanging out of there rooms on the atrium. It would also be great to at least provide free wireless in the common areas. The fee for wireless was almost 10/day and the business center was always full.	5.0
The Aloft hotel is in an excellent location, it is right next to city hall and the market and walking distance to so many other shops and restaurants. The hotel itself is extremely clean as was the hotel room. The room was on the smaller side, but if you're like me and my husband, you're not there to spend all your time in the room. It was plenty of space for the two of us. The bar downstairs is nice, we each enjoyed a cocktail there one of the nights. The only negative I would say is the expensive valet parking, however we went one block north on broad st and found parking for 15 dollars a day. Overall a great stay and highly recommended. Lindsay,Thank you for your kind words! We truly are fortunate to be in the heart of so many great things that Philadelphia offers. I am so glad to see that you enjoyed your stay so much, and that you were able to relax not only in your room, but at WXYZ Bar as well. I look forward to welcoming you back the next time you visit our fine city!Best,Andrew DrydenAssistant General Manager	5.0
I enjoyed my stay at this apartment(even though they were still renovating). The place was very nice,spacious and you didn't feel as though you were bumping heads with others in the apartment. It was like a home away from home.	4.0

We stayed here after our cruise and chose this hotel because of its free shuttle and restaurant on site. Our room was larger than expected and cozy, we were able to get an early check in without calling ahead, and were in our room by 11am. The pool area is nice and clean, staff was helpful. Would stay here again.	4.0
Staff is always friendly and pleasant and responsive to my needs. The office printer and computer worked great and the breakfast excellent as is the service. The kitchen help is always making me laugh and does a great job.	5.0
We spent one night here (in the suite) and wished we had the time to stay longer. Had great vibes - super cool and clean - tons of personality. One of our best hotel experiences ever. Pendleton, itself was also a pleasant surpise. Cool town worth exploring. Warning - the IPA at Prodigal Sons Brewing company sneaks up on you... More	5.0
I was looking for last minute accommodations for an overnight stay in Prescott, I came across The Grand Highland Hotel as they were the only location on Whiskey Row who had availability.

This is a condo resort. We rented a studio, which meant that the bedroom, living area and kitchen were all in one. That suited us fine. The lanai was adequate for us.

Spent a few days in Napa, and found this very clean and comfortable. A little distracted by road noise in the morning, weekdays, and not a huge fan of Denny's, the attached food venue. But really impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel, and friendliness of the staff.Thank you for your review and we hope to see you again.	4.0

We like to fish at Inland Discount Marina. Best Western is perfect for us. The motel is located close to our marina and to a host of places to eat. Very comfortable rooms.

My girlfriend and I liked our room. It was very clean and perfect size for just the two of us. The only thing we were disappointed about was the location of the room itself. We booked the room thinking that it had a view of the creek. We were really wanting to see and hear it from our room. The title of creek side was very misleading. One other issue we had was that we weren't given the information to use the wifi.	4.0
I went for a girls' weekend with two other girls. When we arrived, our room was not ready which we expected. So we went and had lunch. Our server, Javier, was wonderful!

This is a very clean hotel. The staff is always very friendly and extremely helpful! The breakfast is worth every penny and I would recommend trying the French toast. I stay here at least every six months and I am always very pleased with every aspect of my stay!	5.0
The place is not in the greatest location, but the room is comfy, the breakfast is hot and the staffs are friendly. It seems there are a lot of people going there on weekends because I passed by it a lot of times on weekends and the parking lot always seems full.	4.0
This location is perfect: it's walking distance to the French Quarter and to the Business District, yet it's far enough away from the craziness of Bourbon Street that you can get some sleep, if that's your thing. Everyone is very friendly. Rooms are modern and comfortable. Nice shower. The bed was a tiny bit too soft for my liking, but it didn't tarnish my experience in the least.Thank you for taking the time to review your stay with us as we appreciate hearing how much you enjoyed our property and service provided. Sounds like our rooms and staff exceeded expectations which is our ultimate goal and know that our team will be commended for their efforts. It was a pleasure to have you as our guest and we look forward to having you stay with us again.Best regards,	5.0
I recently had a 3 night stay for a company seminar, and would definitely stay again for business or pleasure.

This is a lovely hotel where one is made to feel very welcome. An extra bonus (for cat lovers, at least) is Claire, the resident cat. The hotel is ideally located for exploring the utterly charming French Quarter. Our room was beautiful and very comfortable but as this is an old building, it is not very soundproof and other guests talking in the courtyard and entryway and wheeling their luggage around disturbed us early each morning - at 4am during the first night. The Frette linens and Molton Brown toiletries were much appreciated luxury touches. We were however disappointed by the breakfast - we ordered toast in preference to biscuits and one slice of toast each seemed rather meagre. Be warned - the coffee is flavoured with chicory - a New Orleans tradition but not to our taste. I would recommend this as a place to stay if you are happy to put up with the quirks of an old building but suggest eating breakfast elsewhere.We usually do have pure coffee in the freezer. We don't get many requests but we try to stay prepared. You simply needed to request it. I doubt that anyone could find breakfast spots in New Orleans that serve pure coffee. New Orleans traditional caf au lait is French roasted chicory coffee served with an equal part of warm milk. That is what we serve. That is what Caf du Monde serves. We are famous for our buttermilk biscuits but we do keep gluten free and whole grain bread for the guests who don't eat white flour. I do apologize that you were served only two slices of toast. An order of biscuits if four therefore an order of toast should also be at least four.Please if your travels bring you back to New Orleans give us another try. In addition to the tea , hot chocolate and iced coffee that are always available we will brew pure for you each morning. We will also give you a room on the second or third floor or even on the other side of the street so if we have late arrivals or early departures you won't be disturbed.Claire would be disappointed if you went elsewhere and so would I	4.0
The National Trail Motel is not your grandfather's motel. It is your great-grandfather's motor inn or motor court before the word motel was coined.

This is the second time we've stayed here. It has very nice rooms with separate living room suites. It is cleaned and well maintained. Slight negatives mentioned above were breakfast and road noise.

No elevator, so if you don't mind lugging your bags up a flight of stairs. Average breakfast.

The Central Loop Hotel is in the middle of the hustle bustle of downtown Chicago. They offer a lovely sitting room for visitors to enjoy a cup of coffee and visit with other travelors which we found a plus while using Chicago as a central meeting place for an annual get together with my husbands family. The hotel is very clean and the staff excellent, working to make your vist the best it can be. The restaurant in the hotel had good food with great coffee making it a good choice for a convenient breakfast. The rooms are average, but very clean, although we found them a bit stingy with linnens offering just one towel per person. The best part of this hotel is the location making it within walking distance of the museums and shopping. I highly recommend this hotel if you are ok with staying in a busy, central location.	4.0
The room was great we had a corner suite with a pano view. The staff were great and the restaurants were amazing. Checking in at the tower suites was fantastic. No line ups and very friendly staff. Overall the Hotel is fantastic. Very easy to navigate throughout the hotel as many casinos are very confusing. Good central location as well.	5.0

The Galt House is in a perfect location. It's within walking distance of restaurants, pubs, museums, and shopping. It also has great views of the Ohio River and 4th Street.

Loved this place! If you are looking for a chain hotel, THIS IS NOT for you. If you are looking for different, unique, friendly, fun...then this is it. We chose the little room with Queen bed, no windows..and it was GREAT. Best bed I've slept in while traveling in a long long time. Although there are internal hotel noises every once and a while..it was by no means disturbing or loud. Location was awesome! We mainly hung out on Decatour street/Jackson square/French market..but even bourbon street was a short walk. Hotel staff is very knowledgeable about places to eat and things to do. We didn't drive here so no idea about parking or valet. Staff was extremely friendly. It's just a super little gem in a crazy town.	5.0
Chef Dean and Nicole are amazing! They made us feel welcome from the moment we walked into the Inn. Our room was excellent and the balcony view was great! The breakfasts were incredible. We plan on returning to Europa again very soon!!	5.0
Good: Wonderful hotel with great location and customer service. The lounge was amazing every night for a drink and snacks. Couldnt have asked for a better experience. Breakfast every morning was way better then we expected. Contacting the front desk was easy via text for anything we needed or with questions. We have traveled to many other cities and Europe and this was one of our top stays.	5.0

Bad: The restaurant was closed for the day when we arrived so we had to go out yo eat and the free happy hour that I'd read about had been discontinued. That was particularly disappointing as that was one of the factors I looked at when choosing a hotel. Also, the view we had was the parking lot, not the city view I expected. Good: The bed was very comfortable, what I'd expect from a Westin.	4.0

Bad: Though I booked through Bookings.com, they had no record of my reservations nor could they find any. They compted us and our driver with free drinks until they got it straightened out. Fortunately they still had a double room. The manager bought dessert after our lovely bar light dinner as well!!. Good: We had a wonderful stay prior to an early morning flight to Geneva, Switzerland	5.0
Needed to be close to family at a reasons price. Hyatt was perfect for that. I wish the bathroom was a little bit bigger. And I wish the fridge was a little bit colder. Other than those two things, my room was perfect. One elevator was out but it didn't make much difference. Rode the elevator alone most of the time. Didn't seem too crowded in there. There's always someone at the lobby desk with a smile. In the middle of the night, you wouldn't expect that but all the staff I met were super nice and accommodating. I'd stay here again for sure.	5.0
I stayed here 2 weekends ago, as I was traveling to the Dover Nascar races. The hotel cost 500 per night due to the races!

The hotel is strategically located near the Coliseum. It is surrounded by lots of food, shopping, post office, banking, etc. It is also very easy to get to Langley AFB, 64, etc. There seemed to be a lot of late night activity on the main drive, but very little of that spilled back to this hotel. It is a great alternative to trying to secure a short term lease, but it is like living on your own. The weekly housekeeping is good, but it is only weekly.	5.0
Room was clean, price was reasonable, reception staff weren't overly friendly but were pleasant, maid service staff were very friendly. I did not have breakfast but my husband did and he was satisfied (he is however easy to please). Possibly would stay here again- it served its purpose for this trip.Dear Traveler, Thank you for staying with us and posting a review. We enjoyed having you as our guest.

For the location, right outside of Savannah, the price can't be beat. The staff is very polite and accommodating, the motel is always busy with travelers, so you can assume it's a decent place to stay. The breakfast the following morning is better than most, they actually have pretty decent food. I enjoy staying here, and will come back	5.0
I had stayed at this Hampton Inn many years ago and it was the typical Hampton. They have upgraded since and the accommodations are very nice.

One of the best places you will ever stay in New Orleans. Absolutely delightful and right in the middle of the quarter but far enough away from the noise. This exceptional Hotel has been around for a very long time and there is a reason. Pure beauty and fabulous staff.	5.0
The only reason I rated the condition a little low is because there was a loose screw in the bathroom threshold that could hurt someones bare foot.	5.0

This was our first time in Baltimore, and the neighborhoods are hit or miss there. This was a pretty good part of town- not much there yet. The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. The hotel had a smell to it though- there were smoking rooms I think- but the hallway was very musty. Everything looked clean though. The location must have been a newly developed area, there was not much right by the hotel- but it was convenient to hop on the interstate. All in all, we would stay here again	4.0
My husband and I enjoyed our stay at this property. It was located within walking distance to Canal and Bourbon St. The only unexpected things were the price of parking and the 50 a day hold on our card. The hold is refunded though.	4.0

I was very disappointed with my stay . I was charged 270.00 dollars to my credit card for so called damage. I call to see what they were talking about and ask for pictures to be sent to my e mail .and ask to speak to Manger. Got the run around got hung up on after trying to see what they were talk about . Because room was left very clean . We only took a shower and slept we didn't even use anything else in are room. All towels were left in bathroom in a pile after we used them bed was clean . Are room was left in tact . They haven't refund my money back and has not show me what so called damages. So be aware of their scam !	1.0

I stayed over cuz I had a work event on the same night as the Cubs being in the World Series and didn't want to drive back home. Worked for what I needed but word of the wise it's closer to Alexandria vs DC proper so plan accordingly. But staff was very helpful. I booked very last minute on hotels.com for a king bed but got two doubles which was a bit frustrating as I was a solo person but getting back from watching the game at 2am, I didn't really care enough to call down (I had only dropped my bags off in the room upon checking in and immediately walked out of the room).	4.0
My stay at the Baymont was awesome. The staff was great, friendly and very courteous. I will definitely stay here again, price was very reasonable.

We stayed 4 nights and had a corner room. Its across the street from City Center and the Space Needle. Hop on the Monorail and you are downtown, a short walk to Pikes Place Market.

We spent 1 night here before a flight out of Atlanta.Pros:Super friendly staff. When we checked in the lady in reception was immediately welcoming and happy to answer my questions. Then the guy that shuttled us to the airport the next morning was just as friendly. In fact he got off the bus at the airport to unload our luggage and explained step-by-step how to get to the international terminal. Great staff!Breakfast: awesome! Sausage and eggs were delicious. They had so many choices!Room: huge room with great a/c. Two tvs and plenty of storage space. There was some dried soap on the shower wall that probably should have been cleaned before we checked in, but it's just soap, so no big deal. Also worth noting: I never heard an airplane during the night. I was worried that staying so close to the airport would be loud, but it wasn't at all. Park fly parking area is closed off and well-lit. Hopefully my car is safe. If not I'll edit this review to reflect any issues. Cons:We had an issue with the plumbing in our room. We were only there from 8 pm to 6 am so I can't say whether this was ongoing or resolved, but the toilet didn't flush well. Like it was almost backed up, but it would still flush a little. Also, it would be great if the hotel had a luggage scale. I would definitely stay here again! Con	4.0

We have been staying at VRC the past 7 weekends! By far the best bang for the buck you can get in Vail. Great staff, great units, and the kids love all the activities. Thank you so much Vail Racquet Club!!!	5.0
We were here three nights. there were some kids playing with fire bombs the first coupe nights and there were some smokers right above us that kept throwing their butts over the railing and one night there was a car in the handicapped place right outside our door.

We booked the 4 bedroom suite and were happy with the size and space we had for 9 of us.

This hotel was underwhelming. Even though it is newer construction it had an old feel to it. They put me in the wrong room to begin with. I booked a room with 2 queen beds and a pull out. That is not what I got. I had to wait for the room I booked to be cleaned. When we did... More	2.0
The layout of the suite I had was the best room design of all Hamptons I've resided in previously. It was perfect for the entire family--the layout gave us plenty of space.

This hotel gave me Room 232 next to the ice machine and the elevator. I stayed 2 nights, a Wednesday and a Thursday. The room was pretty clean. The room was dark with insufficient electric lighting.

My lady and I occasionally enjoy overnight stays in hotels. We don't have a lot of money and hotels aren't cheap, so I'm very selective about where we stay. I selected Sonesta because it was close hey 97 and a short drive to Arumdal Mills Mall. I've been previously disappointed choosing familiar brand name hotels in Baltimore. I've learned that brands don't guarantee quality. I wasn't familiar with Sonesta but I figured the hotel had to be good because of the location. I didn't have a clue. Out of all the hotels I've visited within the past 2 years, this is the best. I could LIVE there. EVERYTHING was excellent.	5.0
Everything about this place is great. Location, within walking distance to some of the best restaurants, seafood to Tex Mex, with a very good pizza place right inside the hotel. There are 2 24 hour grocery within a 5 minute walk. The staff was fantastic, rooms were clean and quite.	5.0

My other half and I always enjoy Aloft hotels wherever we go for the modern decor, pet friendliness, and good value. Downtown Philadelphia is no exception. The location is absolutely perfect. You walk right outside and are staring at City Hall on Broad Street. If it wasnt so stinking cold it would have been an ideal location for walkability. Rooms were as expected for Aloft, and value was great as usual. We really enjoyed our stay and hope to return when it isnt so cold outside. Hi Micah, 5 STARS! Wow, thank you! Glad you enjoyed our hotel and of course the perfect location. The weather gods were a little off in their timing for your visit. We are looking at record highs this week, want to come back We've got some space available!Looking forward to your enjoying our backyard on the next visit. Sending warm thoughts...Evan	5.0

I have stayed in some hotels in my time, but this was bad. If you want to experience an awful nights sleep, nasty ignorant staff, then this is for you. Southern hospitality it is not. I was not impressed with the layout of the room and the noise next door was horrendous.Thank you for taking time out of your day to share your comments about your recent stay with me. Please accept my sincere apologies for the difficulties and situations you encountered during your visit, I would like to find out a little bit more about the interaction with the staff so i can address approporately. Rest assured we will address each item with our team for immediate correction. It was disheartening that your first visit with us was disappointing.I truly would love to have the opportunity to have you back as our guest and show you our true service standards.

The only negative was it was supposed to be a non smoking room and as soon as I opened the door you could only smell cigarettes. The hotel was just an exceptional value. I have never tried the Hampton before, but, I will definitely return.	5.0
We stayed over night so we could catch an early flight the next morning. The motel provided transportation to the airport. They were so nice about it! They gave us a free sample beer the night before, and free coffee the next morning. We would have been given breakfast, too, but we had to leave too early.	5.0
This is a clean hotel. The rooms are well kept and tidy. The staff was friendly and accommodating.

Newly remodeled so rooms were fresh and clean although the pillows were too bulky for our taste. Nice that we could open the window. Large pool and hot tub.

We did not like this hotel. We left after one night. It was January in DC, (cold) and the heater did not work in the room. We called the person at the front desk but there was no one available to help with this. We called the front desk again for extra blankets which they did bring. We had booked a room with two beds and were very specific about this when calling for the reservation. When we got to the hotel there was only one bed in the room and no one could help us as the front desk was closed, only someone there to had out keys for late arrivals.	1.0
This hotel had great staff. They promptly got us checked in, helped us with information on Napa Valley wineries. The room and bathroom were exceptionally clean. Bed was very comfortable. Free internet met our needs. Hotel breakfast was vouchers for the Denny's on hotel property. That was nice to have a full breakfast. Property was clean. Our room was quiet (202) with minimal noise from hallway or street. We were able to get good nights rests. Love the microwave and empty frig in the room. Room rate was high due to us being there during an event that this hotel was associated with. So the limited supply and high demand rates were in effect.Katrina,We are glad you enjoyed your stay and it is always good to hear that my staff gave exceptional service. Hope to see you again on your next visit to Napa.	4.0

The Central Loop Hotel was in a super convenient location for walking to the Art Institute, restaurants, and shopping on State Street. I arrived by train, and it was just a couple of blocks walk to the hotel. The manager and front desk staff were very helpful and nice. The room was pretty basic, but clean and neat. Felt safe and secure. The only downside was the hotel practice of placing a deposit on my credit card for any incidental charges. I really don't like that practice. I noticed that I was not the only one, another hotel guest was complaining about it at the front counter while I was there. My hotel charges were paid in advance as a birthday gift from a family member, so I thought I was all taken care of, and then found out that I had to give them my credit card just in case there were any charges in addition. Of course there weren't any additional charges when I checked out. I just don't like having to do something like this.	5.0

Drury Plaza Hotel in Franklin, TN provides you with everything you need for a stay away from home. It's comfortable, clean and cozy in the rooms and suites. All the wonderful extras including the food and friendly staff make it possible to stay in your entire stay if you choose to. It's everything you need and more.	5.0
Bad: Breakfast, though a big step up from the basic continental breakfast, was a little disappointing. The hot option was a choice of three different flatbreads that you can toast yourself. Also, it's only served from 6AM-9AM, fine for business travelers but a bit early for our weekend visit. Good: The hotel seems to cater to long-stay visitors, so the room was set up like a small apartment with couch, TV, desk, and well-equipped kitchen area with a full-sized fridge, plates and silverware, microwave, and dishwasher. Furniture and decor were modern and well thought-out.	4.0
My experience with Best Western has been very good. I like their chain especially in their newer facilities. I typically seek out this chain as well as Hampton and other high end chains.

I booked this room for a concert my husband and I went to. We only needed the room one night but opted for the king suite. Rooms was great, breakfast was willing. You have to walk a little to get to places but if we could do it in the frigid AC air, anyone can. Highly reccomend!	4.0

I arrived early, 10:45am, and I had planned to ask them to just hold my overnight bag, but they said my room was ready so I was checked in by 11 am! Wow!

For someone who had never visited New Orleans before, I could confidently say that the troubadour staff made me feel like I was at home.

My room was always immaculate and the housekeeping team was able to accommodate all of my requests. I look forward to my next stay soon.Thank you for sharing your experience.

Stayed at the Courtyard Lake Union for one night on business and I usually dread staying at Courtyards but was pleasantly surprised how well appointed this property was. I believe it has been significantly renovated and they've done a great job!The location is excellent with a lovely view of the lake and walking distance to many restaurants, bars and sights. It takes about 20 minutes to walk to the space needle and about 60 minutes to Pike's Place.However, I've only given this hotel a 4 rating as 430 for one night is crazy for this level of accommodation.Hello kmalho,Thank you for taking your time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay at the Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union hotel.

Well first off, I paid for a King with a sofa bed Non-smoking. When I arrived and checked in, once in the room I discovered I had been given a full size bed. I immediately called down to the front-desk and the manager said she was all out of Non-smoking King rooms and that she didn't know why Hotels.com booked me and charged me for that room. I told her I had paid for it already and was told that I would have to take it up with Hotels.com. I was extremely upset and she offered me a Smoking King room. I wasn't comfortable with that but because my two small boys wanted to stay in the hotel (just for the pool) I agreed to the king room smoking. We all have allergies so I was a bit uncomfortable staying there but did it to please my boys.	2.0

During our recent stay in Las Vegas, NV we stayed at the Suncoast Resort and Casino. The room was very large with a great view of the golf course (had to pay extra for the view!). The maid was very nice and friendly. We ate at three of the restaurants that are onsite. Good food and a very fair price. There is a movie theater onsite. We went to a movie and was surprised at the size and comfort! Nice! The resort is close to the red rocks. To top off our trip, one of us won a royal flush. Loved our visit-great room, comfortable bed, nice view, quiet, and very welcoming.	5.0
WiFi turns off each 15 min requiring new log in. 2 broadcast channels didn't work, some cable channels scratchy, but HBO and NBC were loud and clear along with all the ESPN and FOX channels.

This Hampton was consistent with my other experiences at their properties, which is why I like staying there. The room was comfortable and well insulated from ambient noise, the staff was friendly and attentive, and the breakfast offered a decent variety of hot/cold items. The one exception was my disappointment with the condition of the bathroom, which had paint peeling on the ceiling, and a tub that was stained from age. It could use a refreshing, and detracted from an otherwise satisfying Hampton experience.	4.0

We stayed in a small queen room for 2 nights. The room is small, but comfortable. I will say, however, that the bed is on the hard side and not the most comfortable. The sheets have a papery feel to them as well. But the pillows are fluffy. Not the typical hotel bed where you feel like you're sleeping on clouds, but it does the trick, I suppose. Still, all in all, the staff is friendly and the location is really convenient if you'll be spending time downtown. The room is quiet and the wifi is free. It's also affordable.

The staff was excellent personable and very helpful. The hotel is top quality, flat screen TV, internet connectivity, and just 3 months old at the time I visited.	5.0
Bad: Rooms were pretty small, definitely not suited for a family but great for a couple. Good: Great location, Comfortable rooms, breakfast was good (beagles, cream cheese, donuts and coffee.)	4.0

On short notice, my boyfriend I decided to pop down for a short trip during Disneyland's off-season. Because it wasn't the busy season, we decided to try out a different Best Western (we usually stay at the Best Western Park Place Inn). This Best Western had a great location, it's just right around the corner from the parking areas.... More	5.0
Hotel was a good choice, about 10 mins from the actual beach but me and my family were satisfied. It would have been 100 perfect if there was an indoor pool, but it wasn't. Great hotel though!	5.0
first class experience! on the metro line! shopping next door!!! awesome sunday brunch !!!!	5.0
The only problem we had with this hotel was the rude manager, but I am addressing that with their corporate offices.	4.0
Loved having a space that we felt could be our own instead of a motel room. Very clean and everything we needed for cooking. Great location and very pleasant folks to deal with. The fact that we were staying in an historical building made it even more charming.	5.0
Bad: Friendlier folks at the front desk...they are the first staff one interacts with at your hotel. They need to make eye contact and smile more. Interact with guests...make you feel welcome. Good: Housekeeping was awesome !!!	4.0
The hotel is listed as 'ocean front' but there 2 buildings. The second building is across the street from the ocean. That wouldn't be so bad but our room faced out on the old rusting parking structure. You could touch the rusting girders from our door. It was very unpleasant - I wouldn't stay here again. Not at all the standard I would expect from Best Western.	2.0
Bad: I booked this property for their GAME ROOM IT WAS CLOSED FOR A PRIVATE EVENT!!! That was very dissapointing because I was with teenagers that could not be in the bar area and needed something to do. I thought it was wrong to advertise a game room that is continously not available because of private party's. And I stayed on a Thursday I'm sure it's worse on the weekends. Good: The renovation looks great. The bar downstairs is great with late night food.	5.0
My daughter and I stayed for one night. I checked in around 8:00 PM and no one was at the desk and there was no bell or any other way to notify staff we were waiting. After a short wait someone came in from a side office area and checked us in, but made no acknowledgement that we were waiting. Shortly after we got to the room I picked up the remote to turn on the TV and found the back cover for the batteries was missing. I pressed the power button on the remote and the TV did not turn on, thinking that because the cover was missing it was the batteries. I removed the batteries and put them back in but that did not work. I then tried to turn on the TV directly and still no power. After tracing the power cable I found that it was unplugged. The power cable would not reach the wall outlet so I plugged it in to the desk lamp on the counter next to the TV. Later that night I saw what looked like a roach crawling on the wall in the bathroom. The bathroom was the size of a small closet where the door had just enough clearance to open before hitting bathtub. There was maybe 3X4 floor space in the bathroom itself. The bed was extremely soft.	2.0
Perfect for a family of four on Chincoteague. Clean, friendly, well-appointed, convenient to everything. A no-hassle getaway for a holiday weekend.	5.0
The Holiday Inn in Butte is a great new addition to the City. It's beautiful and brand new. The hotel is right off of the interestate and is close to nearly everything in town.

We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights during the Easter holidays, we found the staff very helpful, the reception area spacious, with comfortable seating, also an area with computers for guest use, however I found that they were always busy.

Our room smelled like smoke, and they had no other rooms to offer us. I found a spider in the bed when I rolled back the sheets to go to bed. Just didn't think the price was matched by the value. We also were not impressed with the powdered scrambled eggs in the breakfast buffet.	3.0
We had an amazing time at this hotel, although it was a little noisy due to being near the highway, we felt that the location to down town and the awesome staff more than made up for that. They could not do enough for us to make our stay as good as it was. Joe the driver of the shuttle... More	4.0

Nice hotel and perfect location with easy access to ATL domestic and international terminal. Great staff and facilities. Rooms are spacious and good wifi. Amenities are great for a very reasonable price.	5.0
Our room was quite comfortable and spacious. When we found out suddenly that we would not need the room for one night, we were able to cancel without charge even though it was less than 24 hours notice. We really appreciated that.	4.0
My room was clean but everything was run down. The carpet was ripped and coming up near the door and the bedding looked like it came from the 70s. The only good thing was the new flat screen TV. My stay was ok but I would not stay there again the area isn't all that great and I did not feel safe going to my car.	2.0
My wife and a number of her co-workers were staying here for 2 weeks while working at the nearby convention center, I decided to tag along for 5 nights. The rooms come equipped with a small kitchen which is good for extended stays, however you would need a car as there is no grocery store within walking distance. The hotel is about a mile from Disneyland and the convention center, but is reight beside Angels Stadium and has some decent restaurants within walking distance. The biggest issue I had with the hotel is the noise from the trains passing by as the rail line is directly behind the hotel. The temperature was very comfortable in the evening so we left the windows open, big mistake. I was awakened at 4.30am by a train going through with its horn blaring, if you've seen My Cousin Vinnie it was pretty much like that. Having traveled from the east coast I was then wide awake. Trains start coming through on a regular basis after that, pretty much every 1/2 hour or hour. A number of people in our group had the same issues and resorted to Ambien to try and sleep through.	3.0

Don't expect a resort property like so many on this beautiful island. This properties charm is the historic nature and ideal location for an active traveler. Want to island hop the ferry is at your front door. The 4 happy hour Mai Tai's are very good.	4.0
Bad: The fact that the Casino was being renovated and not in use, and that we weren't notified about this prior to arrival. An extra tax being applied to our charges. To call this establishment a resort is simply untrue. No laundry facilities available. No exhaust fan in bathroom. A limit as to how cool the air-con could be set. Good: The size and set-up of our room was very good. The location in regards to the stripwas approx 500 metres away.	3.0
This hotel met Hampton's high quality standards. Rooms were comfortable and clean, bed was great, staff was friendly and helpful.

We stayed... More	5.0

Wow I should have listened to the other reviews. We just needed a place to stay for one night and we thought we would give this place a chance after hearing it was recently remodeled.

This hotel is new and extremely clean (trust me...I checked every corner -) ) and the nice girl at the counter (I think her name was Tari or something similar) was very helpful and knowledgeable. I definitely recommend this hotel. It is right behind a big shopping center and just 30 minutes from Galveston	5.0
PRO -The room was very clean, but old which was consistent with many review I read prior to booking. -The cost was reasonable for the location. -The location was convenient CON Some upgrades were needed, such as: -an exhaust fan for the bathroom - the steam would condense on the ceiling where some mold/mildew and grown, and this liquid mixture would drip down from the ceiling. -the high speed wireless internet was slow and intermittent. My iPhone constantly dropped the signal or could not find it at all. I ran a speed check and the results showed a download speed of 1.39 Mbps and an upload speed of 0.34 Mbps. Perhaps this is high speed in some countries, but in the DC area, I consider this to be quite slow. It was complimentary, however, where other places have a surcharge for internet access. -There was no thermostat for HVAC so the room would go from warm to cool based on the control dial on the unit which was not temperature calibrated, but was simply warmer/cooler. -The elevators were small and slow, but functional. -The 6.00 breakfast did not include eggs or bacon. I hoped for a better meal for the money. Choices included coffee, juice, cereal, milk, sweet rolls, and packaged pancakes. I did not try the pancakes. There may have been other similar choices, but there were no more substantial choices as I recall. The preparation area was quite congested. I might stay there again, but I would not get the breakfast or stay in a room with bathroom mildew.	3.0
I booked my reservation on Motel 6's website. Upon arriving I requested to see my room before checking in. The hotel clerk refused my request and stated that it is the companys policy NOT to allow a person to see a room until after checking in first. (This should have been my first clue to leave.) The hotel clerk stated that after I have checked in that I could inspect the room. Furthermore, the hotel clerk stated that if the room was not satisfactory that I could leave without being charged. Both the room and the building were not satisfactory. It was 90 degrees in Atlanta on my visit and my room as well as the hallway in the building was hot and was not as comfortable as it should have been. The ice machine in the building hallway was in desperate need of repair because it was making an extremely loud humming sound that could be hear all the way down the corridor. The sheets on the bed needed to be changed. The hotel clerk refused to change the sheets and stated that if I wanted them changed that I had to remove the sheets myself. I have never heard of such nonsense. Lastly, the amount of money that the hotel wanted to charge me was 18.00 higher than the amount I was quoted when I made my reservation. Thus, with the bad conditions as well as the bad attitude of the staff, I left Motel 6 the SAME DAY and checked into the Marriott for just 7.00 more than what Motel 6 was charging per night. However, the Marriott gave me a free breakfast each morning compared to Motel 6 only serving coffee.The Motel 6 hotel clerk did not refund me the full amount of the charge to my credit card account. My credit card was charged for one night's stay. I wanted to get out of there so badly that I did not argue with the hotel clerk. I just disputed the charge with my credit card company and received an instant refund. So for the reasons cited above is why I would not recommend this hotel.	1.0
My wife and I have stayed at this BW a number of times and have always been completely satisfied with it.

The staff makes you feel welcome from the moment you arrive. They are all friendly, efficient and caring. Complimentary breakfast stays open until 10:30. I loved the variety of food and especially the fresh strawberries and raspberries. The 6:00 fresh baked cookies every day are yummy!	5.0
This hotel has a lot to offer at a good value. The suite was spacious for the price. It offered a separate BR from the tv watching area and desk. It had two televisions, a fridge and microwave. The staff were courteous and friendly to a fault. This Embassy Suite was very close to the Monuments, literally an exit away. There were restaurants close, as well. As to the extras - the hotel offered on site parking in their private garage. There was a great complimentary breakfast each morning, offering every conceivable food. Last, there was a 3 hour happy hour that offered free drinks (adult beverages as well!) and snacks - daily! This Embassy Suite was very close to the Monuments, literally an exit away. There were restaurants close, as well. We would, absolutely, stay here again!	5.0

This hotel is not within walking distance of the downtown Napa restuarants and shops, but it is within walking distance of several chain restuarants, stores and a movie theater. It served us well since we had a car and spent most of the day exploring the vineyards. They offer cereal bars, juice and coffee in the morning and you receive a discount at the Dennys next door. We would stay here again, mainly because of the cost benefit.Gregory K - Thank you for the great review. We are thrilled you enjoyed your stay and please come see us again soon!	4.0

My brother was in the hospital, and I needed to be there for him. Did not want anything problems until this hotel was not very satisfying. The first night, the hotel only took the trash out in my room. So I made a comment to the front desk, is this unusually just to take the trash out. So she made a note to the cleaning dept. The next night my room was not cleaned at all, so you can imagine how upset I was. One night not cleaned, but two nights. When I complaint again, the front desk just told me it's not there problem. It's the cleaning employees so this upset me even more. They did give me some clean towels for that night so I can shower. Also, I felt the breakfast area was not kept up with the cleaning. Very messy. I would not recommend to stay here. But I did have a king size bed, and it was very comfortable.	1.0
Love the service and the room was very nice. The only compliant I had is it was very noisy. The air/heat unit made a lot of noise, people slamming doors in the hall and the outside street/parking lot noise was bad.	4.0
Not great	2.0
We had two rooms for the weekend and we may have just been there on a bad weekend or something because we planned on leaving around 830 on sunday morning and upon waking up there was no hot water, one of the rooms air conditioning units had stopped working in the middle of the night and it was a humid evening, so we went to the continental breakfast to find no toaster and stale fruit loops. Hot water was available but not until about 1030 so we were about 3 hours behind schedule when all is said and done and we had to stop and grab some breakfast.	2.0
I stayed in the Pontchartrain Suite so that my daughter her 9 bridesmaids could get ready. It could not have been any better! It was spacious enough for everyone, plus the hair make-up crew, as well as friends stopping by. I'd highly recommend it!	5.0

Bad: Rooms felt old. We had a reservation for 4 but not the towels, cups etc for 4. Hair dryer was weak and insufficient. Bathroom counter were way too low and came to my lower thigh. Killed my back.

I stayed her while coordinating a class in one of the hotel's meeting rooms. As the meeting planner, I was upgraded to a wonderful room on the 10th floor. It had a bar, living room, dining area, large separate bedroom and a huge bathroom with a jacuzzi tub and a huge shower. The bed was very comfortable. The meeting facility is very well run, and worth consideration if you have an event. While there is a large selection of restaurants in the casino, I only patronized two: The Cafe Sienna served up a decent, inexpensive early bird breakfast special. The Bagel Cafe Express has pretty good sandwiches, although they seemed a bit pricey. Otherwise, I preferred to get out and eat somewhere else. Across the street are a Cheesecake Factory and a Gordon Biersch Brewpub that are both great places to eat.	4.0
While our overall 2 night stay was not unpleasant and the location is excellent if you wish to be in town, there were a few things that would have made our stay much more relaxing while we were there.

For a Hilton the rooms, small bathtub, and noise in the rooms was horrible. I could hear everything from the room above me and rooms next to me. This was definitely not worth 234 a night or not up to Hilton standards. I would not stay there again. The people that worked there were top class though.	2.0
We stopped here for two nights on the way to Niagara falls and while coming back. Nice hotel. Clean, comfortable, big rooms with a very comfy bed and basic amenities. Price was okay too. Location was good too. Overall we had a pleasant stay in this hotel.	3.0
Pretty good place they are under remodel but they let you know that. You'll feel safe because the cops are always there not because of problems they just hangout there.	5.0
We were not impressed with this hotel. When we reached our floor, it smelled like mold. The rooms were outdated and the bed was extremely uncomfortable.

The staff welcomed us and took care of our every need. We are both handicapped and they did our best to meet our every need. We were very pleased with the Garden Inn and the staff. The room was very clean and all amenities were in place.	5.0
Bad: Not really anything to do with the hotel but we were only in San Fran for a few days and found we spent a lot of time travelling down to the pier for Alcatraz, cycling across the bridge etc. Buses take a long time (so do taxis though) and although walkable (about an hour) if you've only got limited time in the City you might want to think about staying nearer to the Piers or Financial District. Good: Great location for Union Square and surrounding area. Hotel was funky and rooms were HUGE. Great bonus after a long haul flight and when there are two friends sharing.	5.0

Due to Memorial Weekend they have the housekeeping staff off on that Monday! What a great gesture! Clean, comfortable bed, nice pool and connected to Perkins where received a complementary breakfast.

We loved our stay here! It was a clean and brand new facility with all the great amenities... free wifi, great pool, breakfast in the morning, friendly and helpful staff. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone. It's in a great location too! Right next to the highway and just a quick 5-10 minute drive to downtown Charleston (King Street, The Battery, etc.) I would definitely stay here again!	5.0
Pros- Great customer service, comfortable beds, clean rooms, fantastic room style/decor and safe area. Cons- no pool, no meals available, just a few pastry type items at the bar/lobby	5.0
The staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are large and nicely furnished. Feels new, as if we were the first to stay there. Actually it is more opulent than I require. The free breakfast was good with sufficient choices including fresh fruit salad, eggs, bacon, bagels and pastries and more. It was a great location for our purpose:... More	5.0
We had such a wonderful time at the Hilton Garden Inn. The staff was extremely welcoming and helpful. Every aspect of the hotel was in perfect order.

Loved the convenience of staying in this CBD hotel which is so close to the French Quarter but without the price. Hotel is kinda minimalist but rooms were clean. Only reason four instead of five stars is the hallways and my room smelled kinda like a sweaty, bad-smelling locker room. I said something to the hotel and then the smell was gone. Thanks so much for your review. We are happy to hear we were able to resolve that issue you for you while here and hope youll be back again soon. Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager	4.0
We took our family (Kids, grandkids) to Maui to celebrate my 65th b'day. We rented two condos at HK resort...one was a two bedroom, 3 bath ocean front, the other was a one bedroom and den unit.

Overall the hotel was pleasant and staff were helpful and friendly. The amenities were excellent. They breakfast was well prepared and kept fresh.

We had a great time in Charleston. The location of the Mills House was ideal. We parked our car and walked to all the attractions for the next 3 days.

Stayed one night while in the area on business, and I was blown away by the front desk staff's dedication to superior customer service!

Denesha checked me out in... More	5.0
Good: Impeccable service. Beautiful hotel. Don't hesitate to stay here!	5.0
This hotel was perfect for us. We went to DC for a conference but went a few days early to play. The hotel has a shuttle that leaves every hour and takes you to the metro. We got around perfectly from there. The room smelled like it used to be a smoking room and they've been trying to cover it up for a few months but it was livable. The pool was a little creepy and cold at night but that didn't stop us from swimming every night. All in all a great place for the money.	4.0
Spent a week visiting Disney parks and stayed here due to a friend gifting us their Disney Vacation Club points.

I stayed here with my girlfriend for a week, and ended up spending one of those days in the room completely, due to her falling sick with food poisoning. The hotel was clean, comfortable and had a nice breakfast area. People have complained that it is small (which it is) but breakfast can be taken back to your room, which I preferred. There is a computer/printer available to print out tickets/boarding passes and this was very useful as we needed to print out some tickets to Six Flags in order to take advantage of an online-only deal. We visited the Parkstone Grille restaurant once (on the first night) and found it really nice. It was during a Karaoke night, so it was quite lively and everyone loved my english accent (although I didn't sing!) I wish I'd booked two weeks here as the time flew by so fast, and I already want to go back. I would book here again, although the location is a bit awkward if you plan to visit Baltimore on a daily basis (it's a good 30 minute drive each way) but it was close to Arundel Mill Shopping Mall, and some other amenities (such as the Airport)	5.0
We stayed here as a perfect halfway stop on our way to and from a ski trip to Park City, Utah. You enter into a lovely lobby.

The hotel was very unclean and the staff acted as if it was a chore to do their job. I had items let in my room from previous consumers. My room had cob webs in the ceiling and the bathroom was dirty. I spoke with the front desk and she was very nanchalant, telling me someone would call be back but to this day no one called me back. My car almost got towed because the front desk person forgot to give me a parking pass to park on hotel property.

second time that I stay in this hotel, and it was great. Great location, within walking distance to both inner harbor and Fells Point, with plenty of bars and restaurants and shopping. the hotel is right around the corner from a couple of great restaurants (my fave: Ten/Ten) and Whole Foods. the staff is always very nice but the hostess at the front couldn't figure out where the rooms with a view of the harbor were, so although she tried to accommodate our request, we ended up with a room facing the opposite direction, looking at a brick wall... other than than, the hotel is great. very convenient bar/snack station in the lobby, great hot breakfast, and fabulous gym (small pool).	5.0
There are times when I grouse about how much a room might cost because all I'm doing is sleeping there, but there are times when you are staying in a resort area where you may use your room a lot more.

Good: The room was very comfortable, great for a couple. We had a wonderful time, it was very conveniently located to the TD Garden, which is where we were attending a concert. It was also very close to the North End and Faneuil hall, which is a great area to visit for food options that are very plentiful.	5.0
Great location. There was a lot of things going on downtown and the only complaint was parking lot was full and had to use the valet.	4.0
I have to say that I was scare at first that my reservation was going to be denied, because there was many people with that problem before me. But when it was my turn, everything went well and actually because the hotel was full, they gave a better room for the same price. I was happy because it was comfortable and we had a great night of sleep after a very busy day.	4.0

I know you will think this review is too good to be true but this hotel is one of the best we have ever experienced. Front desk staff was great, rooms were spacious and comfortable.

The room was really big and clean. The staff was great. The hotel offers free breakfast that was really good ( not the usual crappy free breakfast) The only thing I didn't like about the room was that the air conditioner was regulated a motion sensor. We happened to be staying here on one of the hottest days of the year. The unit only stays on if the motion censor registers a person being in the room. Upon arriving the room was hot. It took about 20 mins for it to cool off. Also the AC cut off during the night when we fell asleep (No movement). I woke up in a pool of sweat and had to get up a walk around periodically to keep the AC going. That really sucked..	5.0
The hotel was in a convenient location and had a friendly staff. Breakfast and snack selection were good as well as fresh. Check in/check out quick. spacious lobby, comfortable beds and pillows. The hotel was quiet and easy to find off the highway.	5.0
Went for Thunder Over Louisville 2015. VERY polite and friendly staff and desk crew. Ice makers were broken on 2nd and 3rd floors, but there were personnel on site actively working the problem, so it wasn't so bad. Perfect location in the heart of Downtown Louisville. Would certainly stay again next year!	5.0

The hotel is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The location is great and you can easily walk to all the main attractions. It is right by the river which is a nice view. The room was really modern and clean. There was a coffee machine in the room and the hotel provided complementary fruits and soda and water. The staff were really friendly and helpful. I would defiantly go back there and highly recommend it.Thank you, Alex F, for choosing the River Hotel and for taking the time to post a review. We are thrilled to know you enjoyed the accommodations, prime location and friendly staff. We sincerely appreciate your high recommendation and we look forward to seeing you on your next visit!	5.0
Upon check in our room was not ready. It was a non-smoking room, yet guests prior to us had been smoking inside the room. There was a cigarette butt in the corner of the room that house keeping missed. There was an inch between the outside door and the wall allowing bugs inside of the room. There were not enough wash cloths inside of the room for guests. The next morning my daughter fell in the bathroom in the lobby and hit her chin and hurt her wrist. The day of check out my daughter had hit her toe on the concrete car stop, causing us to go into the ER. The hotel overall was loud and dirty. Upkeep was poor. Poor lighting. We could have paid the same price for a hotel room at a Disney property!	2.0

This is an awesome hotel! The staff was very nice and extremely helpful. The hotel is modern and beautiful. The location is excellent, right across the street from the Space Needle. The roof top terrace is lovely day or night with an amazing view of the Space Needle. Easy to get to downtown via a 2.25 trip (each way) on the Monorail to Westlake Center. From Westlake Center, it's just a 10 minute walk to Pike Place. The hotel also provides shuttle service within a mile.Cheryl H,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

Hotel check-in and check-out is efficient. Common areas and rooms are well maintained. Staff was inconsistent in terms of friendliness. Room's window heat/air unit was a bit noisy for me - but I'm a light sleeper. Breakfast was acceptable - fairly standard for this type of hotel. Had issues with the Internet connection speed.	3.0
If Justin Bieber and then-Bruce Jenner stays here, you know it has to be good. This Boutique hotel near downtown, may be small, but it offers friendly attentive service, wonderful facilities, delectable food (from a nearby in my view: 5 rated restaurant) and a good location.	5.0
Bad: Overall I was very disappointed. I rarely write reviews, but I think everyone should keep in mind the following aspects of their trip and take the following all with a grain of salt. For the cost: Paid over 450/night for lowest price 1person room - highly overpriced, and overrated reviews I have to say. I was attending last minute trip for work, but wish I had chosen the Monaco, Drake, Intercontinental...Hyatt, Sheraton...anywhere else. For someone traveling on business, I would equate it to maybe a Hilton Doubletree, for four times the cost. Freebies: I didn't have the time given my work commitments to attend the free breakfast/snacks in evening, as I had to be out at other events, which already provided this. I didn't need the free internet as I had my own. Room Itself: This was probably the worst aspect, yet the most important, and what prompted my very negative rating. I overlooked a rusty building roof - wish I had taken a picture as I don't need gorgeous, but this was anything but. It really looked like if I opened the window I would get some form of lung disease. I would have closed the blinds...but they were blackout blinds...which you don't want if waking up at 5-6 for work events. The room was lackluster, and though there are only 6 floors, there are 2 VERY slow elevators, one of which was not working for a good portion of my stay, so don't try to get anywhere on time, or plan to be late and blame it on the elevators with a legit excuse. Overall: I expected more when I saw the cost, positive ratings, the reviews for boutique - this was anything but. Disappointing stay, especially when my work conference overlapped with my birthday. Will not be returning. Good: On the plus side, the people at the front desk were fine - the doormen were fine and one woman at front when you walk in was extremely nice and I have to give her probably the most positive review for being most pleasant. Other desk guy was fine but clearly apathetic and not going out of his way to be friendly. Appreciated ability to store luggage in between end of stay and flight departure...but again, not something that makes hotel stand out.	2.0
We were traveling through here on a pretty tight budget. I searched for cheap hotels and found this. It looked good enough for what we were looking for, so I booked it.

This is a beautiful hotel room. The high ceilings and dated architecture were appreciated. The suite I stayed in had all of the amenities that I would have needed (had I actually cooked there). Very nice staff. I forgot my toothpaste and within minutes housekeeping brought me a new tube. Other places I've had to go to the front desk, or they would take hours. The work out room was a little dated, but they did have a total body machine that was good to use.	5.0

Today with the economy the way it is everyone is trying to make a dollar. That is understandable. My stay at the Suncoast lost its glitter when I was told I had to pay for a boarding pass to be printed. I could not believe that they do not include this courtesy for their guests. A daily charge of 5 was charged to my credit card. The explanation was that includes all local calls, a safe in the room, a small refrigerator and wi-fi. As far as I am concerned the refrigerator could be removed as a inclusion. I had a room that was extremely noisy and asked to be moved. It took them hours to get this accomplished. I refused to gamble there after being told about the charge for the printing of the boarding pass. We had dinner at the Red Rock and I decided to try and see if they would print my pass for me. I didn't think they would do it but I was shocked. They never asked me for money or even if I was staying there at the hotel as a guest. I explained to the desk clerk what had happened and they couldn't believe it. I was told they print lots of boarding passes for people as a courtesy not just guests of their hotel. This finished me with the Suncoast. I will never dtay there again while in Vegas. It's the principle of the thing that matters. They could have gained my respect and lots more business from my office. There is no reason for this to happen. It is not good PR at all. The Red Rock has all of my future business. No wonder the Republicans didn't go to the Suncoast. The Red Rock rolled out the carpet and knows how to treat people.Thank you for your feedback, and your comments. We do apologize your experience was unsatisfactory. I do want you to know we take all comments as an informational tool to help serve our customers in a more efficient way.	3.0

I great place to stay just off Duval street. The registration staff was VERRY helpful with great suggestions. A very eclectic small hotel. A small bar area was very comfortable. Others have commented on the great bartender...that was not our experience. He seemed to be completely focused on his Brit and Aussie patrons to the exclusion of the rest of us. I would return here for the accommodations and pool area Thank your for sharing your feedback regarding your stay with us.Glad that you enjoyed our location and our facilities.However, we are sincerely sorry to hear that you had a less-than-perfect experience at our bar. And I am 100 sure that if you give them a second chance, our staff will know how to make it right to you. Our bar is one of our major asset within our establishment. Their attention to details and their natural sympathy made them become a reference in the island.We hope he will have the chance to fully meet your expectations during your next venue at the Saint.	4.0
We chose this hotel based on location and cost. Traditionally we prefer hotels that have more comfort and amenities. The Pros:Location (is really excellent)QuietFriendly staffTasty restaurant downstairsThe Cons:The bed/bedding not horrible, but I just couldn't get a good night's sleepOur room smelled faintly of smokeThe elevator took foreverIt was all really just 'good enough.' It was the location that mattered most in the end. It was very easy to walk to almost all of our sight seeing destinations.	3.0

We chose this hotel because of its proximity to Troegs brewery and Hershey Park. We enjoyed the modern, comfortable, and quiet room. The staff was exceptional and the accommodations were enjoyable.

I went with my family. The hotel is very new and service is good. On the downside it's far from Napa downtown and farther from the wine yards. Breakfast can get very crowded. There is a cinema and some restaurant at walking distance if you don't want to drive. Good place if you don't want to drive further to get to the attractions. Dear Alejandro M,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We thank you for your feedback and comments. We are located near several restaurants and the Cinema which is very convenient for travelers to the area. There are over 500 wineries in Napa and depending on which wineries you are looking to travel to our hotel does have easy access to the local highway to get you to your winery destination. We thank you again for your valuable feedback and hope to serve you on your next trip to Napa, Serina Najar.	4.0
Someone probably a man and left the toilet seat up and hadn't flushed the toilet. Not a good look and not a comforting thought when you check into a room. My biggest pet peeve is hypoallergenic rooms should be part of a hotels standard capacity. Why should a consumer have to advise the front desk to have someone from housekeeping come in and change out pillows and maybe a comforter. Be proactive not reactive, it makes more the hotel more appealing to consumers and brand loyal	4.0

I've been traveling for business for fourteen years (about every other week), and this was the best stay I've ever had. (That's not an exagerration this was the BEST stay that I can remember.)

Looked for an overnight on a long journey so just wanted a clean, quiet, comfortable room at the cheapest price available and this establishment met those requirements for us. It's an excellent deal at a very excellent room rate. Loved our king size bed and tv and robust wifi. Very quiet,quick check in, clean surroundings. Obviously the management is quite particular about appearances as this is unusual compared to other Red Roof Inns we have seen. We picked it because of the other reviews and are impressed that the management responds to each review. That's personal attention! Our check in person was just neutral until I began a conversation. I think a welcome smile and greeting should be a given, but that is my only recommendation. Overall, for the price this hotel is exceptional.	4.0
Clean rooms with no frills.It is in a good location for walking to shops and bars. It is a little expensive for what you get, big chain budget motels offer more for less cash. The pool was in use when we stayed. there was free coffee available in the office.	3.0

The Holiday Inn Express is on the north side of town in an area with other hotels, some restaurants and some box stores. The receptionist was friendly, the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Rooms have fridges, irons and TVs with a good selection of channels. Breakfast is included in the price. The bedroom was attractively furnished. The bathroom was a bit dowdy. But the hotel did what was needed - provide a safe and comfortable place to spend the night while on the road.	3.0
The front desk person was extremely nice and helpful. He allowed us to change our room three times before we (my wife who's pregnant) settled on a room that was easy to walk to and from elevator, able to see vehicle from room window, and right side orientation. The free breakfast buffet was a BIG plus! The indoor pool and hot tub were clean and very nice to enjoy with visiting family for Christmas!	4.0
My fiance and I came here to celebrate our engagement (he proposed on the trip). We absolutely loved the room. Ours had a glass curtain wall which could be folded away so the entire room was open to the outside. It was gorgeous. The room's were well-appointed and the staff was friendly. We were surprised, however, by the 25 a... More	4.0
Our stay was made so special by the staff here. They went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable and had all we needed. They were determined to make our anniversary weekend a memorable one. The facilities were all clean and the helpful staff was always smiling.	5.0
I was blown away by the lobby and halls. Our room was less than spectacular as it was a hotel tonight booking and probably was the last room in the building overlooking an alley. Even so the small room we had was well worth the money and did the trick.	4.0
Bad: Rear and side views from the 4th floor not great. No late night lounge option to have a byob drink with friends and family. Good: Spacious room. Comfortable bed. Friendly staff. Fantastic location.	5.0
These rooms are great if you're in town for a limited purpose, ie (business trip, seeing friends or family, etc). However, I don't recommend if you're looking for something fancy or romantic. It's a very old building and a little run-down. I wasn't wild about the location either. It's tucked away and kind of hard to get to if you're not familiar with the area. If you can get a deal through one of those sites out there, do it but it's definitely not worth what they tell you over the phone.	3.0
We stayed here for 2 nights, and we chose this hotel based on the reviews we read on hotels.com. Unfortunately, the hotel was not what I expected. It was not clean, and was very run-down and dated. The front desk staff members were not pleasant, and one of them was downright rude. Their free breakfast was definitely a disappointment, as it was lacking in quality. I suppose since it was free, there's not much that I can complain about. The food was tasteless, there wasn't enough on hand for all of the guests (except for the cereal) and the breakfast area was very dirty. I would not stay at this hotel again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else.	1.0
We stayed at Best Western in DeRidder, LA as a group with a baseball team for a tournament. It was a nice place to stay and convenient location to where we needed to go. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The staff was really helpful and nice.	4.0

I had a fabulous stay. We stayed in the Tower Suite and it was fabulous. I would stay again. The only thing I didn't like is that they didn't have a microwave. I love the bathroom and the view was on the strip so it made it beautiful.	5.0
We checked into this hotel on Saturday for one night. Check in was smooth and easy. We asked for a first floor room when we reserved. They only had an ADA room left which was fine with us. We travel with a lab and first floor is easier for her. The hotel was quite pet friendly but the dog walking area was limited and there was no bag and disposal station. The location is convenient and right off I10. The area is a little run down but I not to the point of feeling any safety issues. The room was comfortable and clean with the usual amenities. The air conditioner was hard to get on the right temperature. The was no wall temperature setting so you had to adjust it at the unit which was an older knob type. It took quite a while before we were not frozen out (which is better than the alternative in Phoenix). The hallway carpet was getting a little worn and could stand to be replaced. On to the breakfast. This was a pleasant surprise as it was better thsn the typical La Quinta breakfast. First of all there was real coffe, not an instant machine. There was also sausage links and multiple berry toppings for the waffles and whipped cream. I usually don't eat these things for breakfast but since they had them it was a nice treat. The cinnamon toast also looked inviting.Overall a good stay for one night. Given the lack of other things to do at that location I would not consider it for an extended stay.	3.0
I would never stay at this hotel again. My room in the south tower, 1927 was filthy dirty and it looked like the carpets had not been cleaned in years. The lamp was broken, the wall by the AC looked like it had severe water damage and probably mold. I woke up to cold showers every morning and the shower... More	1.0

This was our second stay at a Drury Hotel and we were impressed once again! The rooms were clean and fair sized, check in was easy and quick.

Location was very convenient, although using their free shuttle to Metro Station probably is not that convenient. We just parked at the station for 4.50/day. If you don't have a car, then I think you could make the shuttle work for you, or take a cab. We booked 2 rooms. Cons: Both were very small, with shabby, 80's looking furnishings. Rooms had an unpleasant musty smell that a/c didn't remedy. One room we booked did not have a fridge and microwave although the hotel lists that as an amenity for their rooms. Ice machine only available on 2nd floor. There isn't one on 4th floor and the one on 3rd floor didn't work. Old-style TV's when almost every other hotel in this category has nicer flat screens. Beds, while somewhat comfortable, were made up with not so great linens (thin sheets, old bedspreads). No laundry room, which is only needed for multi-day stays. Pros: Good housekeeping service swimming pool kept very clean with a lifeguard present at all times, towels are sometimes available at the pool EXCELLENT full hot breakfast available with enough options for daily variety for a multi-day stay. All in all, would probably look a little closer at another Springfield, VA lodging option if visiting in the future. Although most of our time spent in a hotel room is simply sleeping or preparing to go out for the day, would prefer to have just a little more elbow room than this hotel offers.	4.0

We brought our 6 year old granddaughter to Chicago with us. We have stayed at this hotel at least 6 times and have never been disappointed. The location is perfect for walking to many touristy spots. We even walked to and from union station. Thank you for staying with us recently and for your kind recommendation both are greatly appreciated! We are pleased to hear that you are a great fan of the River Hotel and delighted that your granddaughter had a wonderful stay.

We stayed for one night after flying into BWI at 1:00 am. The complimentary airport shuttle was very convenient and the first driver we had was great! The second driver made us wait about 20 minutes while he was chatting it up with a woman that worked there which could have made things difficult if we were needing to be at the airport for a flight instead of just picking up our rental car. There weren't any restaurants or fast food within walking distance of the hotel and we were hungry after traveling all day, but they did give us some bagels and cream cheese because they felt bad. There really isn't much of anything by the hotel, but the beds were comfortable and it was a quick and easy check in. All in all, I would recommend this hotel for short stays like we had, but not for a long trip only because there isn't anything close by.	4.0

stayed here for a dog show weekend. Really appreciate being able to keep my dog with me here. Grounds are well maintained, but I did step in another dog's feces outdoors...dog bags would be great and a handy trash can. Room was clean and quiet and close to dining and museaums and 81. Bedding was lacking however - thin and even an extra blanket did not help much. Shower rocked and loved having a bathtub.

Bad: Used my credit card to hold reservation but was going to pay cash. When I checked out they said they already processed my credit card and would not refund it and l could not pay cash. I am from Canada and have a US bank account so when the Can and US dollars were at par I put my travel money into it. By paying with my credit card, I ended up paying an extra 150 in exchange rate and user fees. They also charged my credit card the day I booked- which I didn't know until my statement came in.

There is an 18 per day charge for parking (very well secured) which is not disclosed in the expedia information. Other than that, the hotel was pretty nice.

The breakfast buffet was not up to ES standards compared to others. Hotel was very clean. Oh, and the elevator, you have to take one up from the garage then another up to the rooms and elevator service was slow, small often cramped with people or guests with luggage.	3.0
Really I know 3 stars on Priceline can be dicey, but really Really We got a quad. Four 5 1/2 foot long bunk beds. Numbered one to four. With a stack of folded sheets. And a 2 by 2 shower. Really How did this get on Priceline in the first place And how did it get any stars I am only writing this now because it is 1:30 in the morning and my dorm was like a library compared to this place. Decades ago. How did this get on Priceline I have stayed at more than 40 hotels in Chicago on Priceline over the years, but this is the first time I have stayed in a hostel. A hostile. Really I wish zero stars was a choice, but that would be too many. I know all the hipster comments I will get on this, but please, keep them to yourself.Hello Steve P, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay. I so sorry that your stay was disappointing due to the room layout not being as expected for our star rating. We are reviewing your reservation with our booking partners to ensure that no other guest encounters a similar issue.

A good value hotel with all the amenities you need located on the main routes into and around Washington DC. Now looking a bit tired the rooms are functional and clean. The hotel operates a complimentary minibus shuttle to any location within 3 miles of the hotel, this includes the nearest DC metro station and a large shopping mall. The hotel is located literally on a highway junction which makes getting to and leaving on the right highway an entertaining challenge. The complimentary breakfast is a good start to the day. In summary, a good value option that ticks all the right boxes for a visitor on a budget.	3.0
Definitely not worth the regular price of 169 a night! Got it for half on Priceline. Broken towel rack in room. Frayed carpet in the bathroom area. Peeling paint in the shower area. Almost seemed like we got a third party quality room since we booked through a third party. Front desk is a kiosk with someone standing behind a... More	3.0
Do not expect New England-ish BB with antique furniture and doilies all over. The room is Spartan and rustic and very clean.

This was a convenient stop on our way from Indiana to Florida. It is a handy Off and On to I-77. The hotel is in top shape and our room was large and comfortable. The bed was one of the best we have had in a hotel. We would be happy to stay again.	4.0
Clean well-furnished room with good amenities including minifridge and microwave. Fitness room with up-to-date equipment. Nice indoor pool with whirlpool hot tub.

This was such a beautiful, clean hotel. A fantastic location with great staff. Our first night was very loud, so they happily moved us to a different room the next morning.

The room was basic but clean and comfortable. I asked for a ground level room because I have a bad knee and would've had difficulty with stairs, especially taking my dogs out.

The old Aztec Hotel on foothill blvd, ( route 66) was a gem, back in its day. Unfortunately for the past ten years while the hotel was under poor management it was never maintained. The entire establishment is dirty and run down. The rooms are very small, which was typical for hotels during that era. Some staff are friendly, others were not willing to help when needed. Bar is a local hangout with a pretty good Band. The property needs a complete overhaul.	1.0
When this hotel first opened I adored it. I visited regularly and it became the benchmark of what a brilliant hotel should be. The decor was magnificent, the staff attentive and the little quirks throughout the hotel (including free calls to the UK), really made for a 5 star experience. My recent stay however, not so, and that's because the... More	2.0

Friendly desk staff, fairly clean, and reasonably comfortable (albeit slightly worn) mattresses.

Probably the worst I have ever experienced at a hotel. - A/C setting gets overridden in the middle of the night and the room gets very warm and uncomfortable... More	3.0
Heater was blowing cool air in morning. Some things in the room seemed shoddy or unfinished like sprinkler, wall around the light switch, and when you first enter one of the lightswitches that I believe was meant to turn on the lamps did nothing. Also we were only there one nite but in that time our room keys both got deactivated. We were very pleased with complimentary breakfast offerings except that there was cream cheese but no bagels and the type of milks were not labeled.	3.0
I would stay again! Clean and comfortable. Breakfast ladies were super friendly and made sure everyone had what they wanted and were not rushed to clear everything off the shelves like some places are. Made us feel relaxed and welcome there. Thank you!	5.0

The Honua Kai Resort and Spa was the best place for our family to enjoy all that Maui has to offer.

The location and view were very impressive with very large pool and playground. The stream flowing around the facility was spectacular. The staff was very friendly.

A once very nice hotel to stay at, has fallen into serious decline.

I have never had to ask for a refund due to cleanliness of room. I asked for a refund on this very dirty room. The attendant lady was violently screaming and refused to give me a refund.

We stayed at this inn just for one night while visiting the college of Charleston. The hotel and the rooms are quaint and certainly within walking distance of all of the activities in Charleston.

We just returned from a 6-night stay at the Ocean Tower and we loved it. Great location- less than a block from the beach. We knew it was an older hotel with rooms that needeed some updating, but the rooms were fine. Very clean and with comfortable beds. Our room (906) had a terrific view of the ocean and it had a balcony with a view of Diamond Head. It was probably the best room in the hotel. The hotel staff is great! Very, very nice and helpful. The free breakfast is coffee, juice, and sweet rolls. The coffee was available starting at 6 am and the rest was available 7:30 - 9:30. Breakfast is adequate. Again, the staff are always there to help. We were given some juice at noon as we checked out.This hotel is a great value. It may not be a 4 or 5 star hotel, but it is more than acceptable and a real bargain for the money. The managment has big plans to upgrade the rooms. We were shown two rooms which have just been remodeled and they are awesome (an oriental-type design with plenty of high-end amenities). Look for the remodeling to take 12-18 months to complete. They plan to remodel 2 floors at a time. When the remodel is done, this will be an excellent hotel. As a smaller hotel with only 9 floors, it offers a more intimate atmosphere and there are no long waits for the elevators.We highly recommend this hotel!	5.0
This place was a dud..Swimming pool was more like a bath tub... The view from the balcony was of a traffic light....Location is not bad, but not next door to vineyards...Worthy of no more than 75-90.Thank you for your review. We are always trying to lead in the best value in the Napa Valley. During the Harvest Season the demand is very high and we are inline with our competition and our average rate is one of the lowest in the valley. Tip: Best hotel rates are between November 11th and April 30th.	2.0

We got to the hotel about an hour or two early and asked if we could check in early and the receptionist said no, not until check in time. Understood so me and my friend grabbed food. We got back to the hotel and checked in. We walked into our first room and it was a disaster. There were holes in the bed sheets and they had a rank smelled. We went back to the front desk and changed our room. In the second room, the bed sheets had black stains and rips in them. So I went back to the front desk and changed again. The third room - one of the beds had holes and rips in the bed sheets. I went back to the front desk and expressed my frustration. She said she would have a house maid change the bed sheets. The next morning when we went to shower there was only 1 bath towel in the shower. We called the front desk and they said they would have towels to our room quickly. About 30-40 mins later, a hotel maid comes to our door and hands us a small face/hand towel saying all the other towels are getting washed right now. This was the worst hotel experience I have ever had.	1.0
I liked this hotel a lot. Service was friendly, suite was sizeable, clean, comfortable, with a decent view. Nice neighborhood with good nearby restaurants. The only issue I had was that the bed was too firm for my taste. Not too far from the airport and the mall.	4.0
Wasn't expecting much from this hotel due to the low rate, however the staff was very organized. I called earlier in the day to let them know I would not be arriving until 11pm. The front desk staff had my key and paperwork sitting out when I arrived. I was in the room in a few minutes.The room itself, had a real king size comfortable bed in it. The room was decorated well. The bathroom was neat, a shower with just a glass wall.The restaurant and bar were very nice, although I only went to the free continental breakfast.The hotel looks like it was updated within 10 years, but then has had alot of use.Only room issues were the shower and bathroom drywall had taking a beating with the lack of a shower curtain, it should be fixed. Looks like the maintenance staff just threw some spackle and painted over the water damage.My room faced the highway, so it was rather loud all night, however the AC was loud enough to drown out the noise. If you stay more than one night I would suggest getting a room facing the other way. The TV only has basic channels, no HBO or Showtime.	4.0

The location was right off the highway which was perfect. The hotel is outdated, but the rooms were clean and functional. Everyone working here was very happy and helpful. It also had a decent breakfast. All in all I thought it was a great value and would stay here again..	4.0
Bad: Advertised amenities came up majorly short. Mini bar is locked and does not have any alcohol. Shower appears to have steaming functionality, but didnt work. Breakfast was bread, cereal and hard boiled eggs. Considering you pay 20+ in resort fees, you'd think they'd put a little more effort into the little things. Good: Room was gorgeous, bed was comfortable, shower was nice, starbucks coffee machine is nice.	3.0

The hotel and staff were nice but upon check in I was given a double when I requested a KING. About 3 hours into my stay another family was trying to enter my room.

The lobby is very nice and looks like it was refurbished somewhat recently. Breakfast is okay, nothing great. Waffles are frozen and you have to put them on the toaster.

I thought the hotel was very nice. The staff was wonderful! They were very helpful and friendly. Only thing I did not like was the hotel allowed smoking out in front of the main entrance. It is fine with me if people choose to smoke, but when you are waiting for a shuttle and have about 6 or more people standing around you smoking it is a little uncomfortable for those who do not smoke. The only other thing that I did not like was one day when we were on the shuttle there was a young women already on when we got on. I am not sure if she was an employee of the hotel but it was clear she was not a hotel guest. I do not know your rules on people riding your shuttle but here is what the problem was this women took up 2 seats - the shuttle was full and people, guest of the hotel, had to stand. If she was not a guest of the hotel (which from her conversation with the driver I am guessing she was not) the drive should of had her stand so that people who paid to stay at the hotel could be seated. If she was an employee of the hotel she needed to move over to allow a guest to sit with her and not take up two seats. That was a little disappointing but that being said the shuttle service was great. Right on time every day you have to love that! It was my son's first time to D.C. thank you for making it a great trip.	5.0
Staff was excellent. Room was great and the atmosphere of the hotel was wonderful. As far as location - how can you go wrong a block off the beach	5.0

I have visited this hotel twice now. On the first, I enjoyed a king-size bed and a clean room however, on my second visit to this hotel I found that the bedspread had a visible stain on it as soon as I entered the door. The towels which were meant to be white didn't appear to have been bleached at all, so they were dingy. On the floor leading to the bathroom was a red stain which I cringe to imagine what it consisted of. Overall, the room wasn't as clean as the one I enjoyed on the first visit.	3.0
Hotel was clean. Very loud at night. Two bars out front and the strip. Balcony door very hard to get back in and railings spaced out (2 yr old got head stuck). Overall nice stay. No one came in to clean room, just dropped off towels. Close access to beach and everything else.	4.0
Lovely hotel with an amazing rooftop bar. The rooftop bar is on the 17th floor looks out over the city with couches and sitting areas besides a big bar to sit at. Rooms were decorated nicely with a touch of orange as the signature color. Bellmen and concierge were very helpful with good advice for where to go. It's in walking distance of Bourbon St but wear comfortable shoes There is lots of walking and sidewalks are uneven most everywhere you go. Of course, taxis and Uber are available. Thank you for taking a few minutes to share your experience. Happy Birthday!!! We appreciate you sharing your comments for others to get a feel of The Troubadour and our Monkey Board rooftop bar, we are excited to hear you enjoyed the atmosphere up there. The team will enjoy reading your comments and we thank you for recognizing all their hard efforts. We look forward to seeing you again soon, at least before your next birthday!WayneGeneral Manager	5.0

I stayed here because the location is close to all the attractions, restaurants, and beaches. The bonus is the low price compared to all the other motels in the area. It is clean, nicely furnished and a very friendly staff. I recommend this motel highly	5.0
Check in is easy. Close to gas stations and food. Room for truck and RV parking. Rooms are basic and hotel clean. Wifi is good and continental breakfast is good. Pet friendly.

Staff was friendly. Breakfast was great, especially the coffee! It was very modern and up to date. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because we requested a non smoking room, and unfortunately the room smelled like cigarette smoke. They did spray the room, but it only improved it slightly.	4.0
The front desk service was very good. The location and proximity to tourist attractions was great. The beds were very uncomfortable.

Bad: The staff, specially at the restaurant is arrogant and not well trained. The pool area wasnt cleaned in the morning, cleaning ladies came later on and did only the basic to clean it. Rooms in the first floor are noisy and you can hear the music of the restaurant below. A gym would be a very nice to have. Good: The rooftop pool was so nice and with a beautiful view to the sea. Rooms are absolutely cosy. The restaurant is nice furnished and serves excellent food. Excellent location.	4.0
Traveling with our High School Varsity Girls Basketball team to a Holiday Tournament this past weekend in Boise I spent two nights at the Oxford Suites and enjoyed it thoroughly.

The best thing about The River Hotel is the staff! They make you feel extremely welcome and that they cannot do enough to accommodate you. I was particularly impressed with Pedro on the front desk, who was cheerful and obliging, and a great ambassador for the hotel. The location is perfect, and the rooms both comfortable and private. Great value for money. I thoroughly recommend the hotel to anyone visiting Chicago.Dear azelinaf2017,Thank you for giving us a perfect rating and for recommending our hotel to other travelers.

I booked at this hotel because on the NIH Clinical Center website, it was one of the hotels listed as convenient to the NIH. However, that is false! You can take the metro red line to the NIH, but it will take you a long time, as it is several stops away. One morning, it took me 2 hours from leaving the hotel to arriving at the NIH because there was track maintenance! If you are in town to visit the NIH, I don't recommend staying here. Otherwise, the hotel is fine, the room was a little small, but clean. Also, the elevator interiors could use some upgrading. The carpet was dirty and ragged.	4.0

Great location: we wanted to find a hotel that was centrally located enough to not need a car, and the Hyatt House fit the bill. We flew into SeaTac Airport, took the light rail to downtown (Westlake stop) and took the Monorail to Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP Museum, Chihuly, Key Arena) which is right next the the Hyatt House. Great accommodations: the hotel seems brand new, extremely clean and modern, very spacious. Great staff: everyone was very nice and informative. We got to town about three hours before check-in and they let us check-in early. Great free breakfast: in addition to many choices, there is also a made-to-order omelet bar. Jay cheerfully made the omelets every day and they were excellent. And he would remember my name each day which is pretty amazing:) Other: they have a free shuttle which will take you where you want to go within a certain distance. The gym is not bad, although it is on street level with big windows, so you kinda feel like you are working out in a fish bowl. Great restaurants, coffee shops shopping within walking distance. About the only thing I didn't like was the parking - 25/day (we rented a car a couple days to visit the mountains) but there are cheaper parking lots within a block so it wasn't that big a deal. Check all the travel sites to compare prices - I found one that had the same room for 20 less a night than the rest. Overall the Hyatt House was an excellent choice for our Seattle vacation!Cushionhead,It was a pleasure accommodating you recently at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown and we sincerely appreciate the glowing review! I have shared your feedback with the team regarding your experience and will strive to make sure we are exceeding all of our guests expectations. Please let us know when you visit next as we look forward to having you as our guest!Sarah Junge	5.0

How great is it, having 5 little girls to find a hotel that's affordable, clean, and FITS US ALL LEGALLY!!! Best western rocks. We love it, and we're probably gonna be using them exclusively. We are a traveling family band, and we find these 2 queen suites to be just wonderful. Breakfast was better than average, and the pool rocked.... More	5.0
Nothing particularly wrong with this hotel, but nothing stood out as great. Check-in/out was easy with friendly front desk staff. Hotel is located near the highway, so getting in and out was easy.

For the it was OK, I would stay again, the TV is an off brand and Made some noise on some channels, breakfast is OK, but nothing to write Home about frozen egg Mc muffins. I would give it 3 stars max	3.0
Had a room on the harbor side and was treated to a manatee siting our first evening there. Comfortable, clean room with washer/dryer--great for tennis players. Excellent time at the tennis center--games set up for us by Zoe every day we were there. Rode bikes one afternoon, one afternoon at the spa--perfect!	5.0
I really like this hotel. The staff is friendly helpful. The rooms are clean and comfortable. It is quiet and allows for a great nights sleep. For the price you can't beat it. As a female on business alone I felt safe in this hotel. The lobby is bright and always staffed.	5.0

I actually booked this hotel while I was on the plane to Oahu. Before I came, I saw that it had 4 stars on Yelp and pretty high ratings here, so I booked a one-night stay to check it out.

There is no finer staff I have found in my stays in hotels. Perfect location for attending an Army Graduation. Clean,Clean Clean room. The only flaw is there is no place to eat lunch or dinner on site. Columbus GA is a bit complex to drive about if you are new to the area	5.0
Perfect view! Perfect staff! I reserved a room for my family and I, we had such a nice and relaxing time. The room was like an apartment, it felt like home. The rooms were clean and smelled clean.

Did not choose to stop at this motel, was too tired to risk driving further on to New Mexico and the other place in town was booked. The bed was absolutely terrible.

I have stayed at many Marriott Courtyards, but this was my first stay at the property in Gainesville.

This it's the place to stay if you just wanted to relax and not do a whole lot of activities. The price is very decent since you're away from the strip (about a good 15+ mins. away). The rooms are clean and the staff are very friendly. Bowling alley and game room can keep the kids entertained. Ask for a room with golf course view.	4.0
Good: Structure, room	4.0
We stayed for one night on our way to Cody Wyoming. The room was excellent, the bed was very good. The included breakfast did the job. The hotel was great in all respects. The only drawback was the limited dining opportunities at that location.	5.0

We had a very large room, large table, large TV with many channels but no HD, fridge, microwave, good AC, nice furniture, and a small bathroom with limited counter space. Staff was very friendly.

The hotel is very out-dated - it had the felling of going to Catskill, NY for family vacation in the 50s. I was told that it was family owned for sixty years and I am sure that not many changes have been made during that time. It's hard to say what needs to be done - it was fine for us people who still remember 60s but our children were a little bit disappointed that kitchen and other amenities were not updated. Rooms were clean, cleaning service was friendly and responsive however everything looked rugged, old and lacked any charm. Too bad because the place is located in beautiful part of Carmel Valley. On the other hand if it exists for 60 years people must find it attractive and I wish the owner(s) good luck with this place for the next 60 years.	4.0
The hotel was quiet, exterior condition was poor, interior was very nice for the price.	3.0

We have stayed at this hotel about once a year for the past several years. It is always just as advertised. We only need a place to shower and sleep.

I have stayed here a few times for business. It is a good location with lots of options for retail shopping and dining. The hotel is clean and the breakfast is good with fresh fruit and hot eggs in addition to standard fare. King of Prussia Mall is right across the street.	4.0
I was so disappointed in this property! Threadbare, torn carpet, no guest services until 6am, dingy outside. I didn't feel comfortable the entire time I was there. Does not look anything like the photos posted. Until they do a major renovation, find another place to stay.	2.0
Nice clean place and the room are very spacious. The pool is heated and Jacuzzi is nice and big. Breakfast is okay.. scrambled eggs, sausages, waffles, muffins and whole fruits. We stay here almost every time we come to Erie.	4.0

Stayed here for two nights and had a great time. This hotel has the best redemption for SPG points value, and we took advantage to pamper ourselves. It was really very nice, though one mishap occurred when we were billed for something in the bar that we didn't order. The reception cleared it for us right away without the hassle we may of experienced at some other hotel. We didn't receive the 5th Ave view we were hoping for, but that's only fair when using points. Would definitely stay again.Dear Rose2li, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent visit to New York City.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels which we pride ourselves on.Thank you for your time in reviewing our property on TripAdvisor, and please let us know when you will be returning, as we would love to have you as our guest.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager	5.0
We stayed for one night while passing through on the way to Florida. What a great experience! The staff was so friendly and welcoming, the rooms are comfortable, beautiful and clean. My daughter loved the pool, and it was kept up nicely. Not having to leave for dinner or breakfast was a huge plus. All the guests we met while there had smiles on their faces, I'm sure it was because of the great atmosphere Drury staff created.	5.0

Bad: There was nothing I didn't like! It was the best!. Good: EVERYTHING! The staff was amazing and friendly, very courteous, always made sure you were ok and comfortable. They gave suggestions on things to do and places to go...simply amazing! The hotel smelled amazing, it's the first thing you notice walking in! It's very clean and nice. You get beach towels, a chair and umbrella. The beach is literally a block away, and you're also located a block from all of the action of South Beach. The hotel is located in a quieter area, so it's great to wind down after a long day. This hotel was one of the highlights of our trip! We will always stay here for our trips to Miami, I'm so happy we chose this hotel!	5.0
Virtually the only place for any regular live music and good entertainment in town or to have interesting, intelligent conversation with the awesome staff. A very lively and intimate bar.	5.0
The hotel was nice for a weekend getaway. Nice staff and clean room. The best part was the full kitchen, which had everything you would need to cook and eat, all you need is to supply the food.	5.0
Bad: I wanted to watch Netflix and couldn't, BUT THEY SAID NETFLIX WAS COMING!! By the end of August the hotel is getting new TV system to watch my shows! So my one negative will be fixed!!. Good: The staff was amazingly friendly! Breakfast was on each guest room floor and got to have breakfast in bed!! Free food and drink in the lounge every night. It was so easy to get around the city. Most of it was within walking distance, but I took the L to Wrigley Field. Super Easy! Free Wifi as well.	5.0
I heard positive things about the Chelsea hotel and booked a room for my anniversary in the Annex. I had no idea that this was a dingy, dirty motel connected to the the actual Chelsea hotel.

So I stayed there last week. At first blush it seems pretty similar to all these business hotel chains.

We were staying for one night for the BOA Marching band competition. I reviewed all the pictures online and read the reviews. You will always have mixed reviews. Based on the information I decided to book the night. The hotel lobby's door was broken. The front staff upon checking in were not personable. They provided us the room and upon entering that part of the hotel, it was not too clean and this had me worried. I had read about a newly renovated part of the hotel and prayed we would have it. No such luck. The room smelled, there was a dirty toothbrush in the corner of the room. There was also a burn mark on the carpet from an iron. I was so embarrased for my family that I actually booked this. We stayed anyway because I did not want to lose my money. Upon waking up my back hurt so bad I couldn't breathe. I could not wait to go home.	1.0
Once you get settled you feel like you are in the country. You would never know Rio Grande Blvd fronts this property. The room was comfortable and the bed allowed a restful night's sleep.

The price was that of a hotel but it was really more like a motel. The hotel was clean and quite. But the cost was the highest I've ever paid at a BW. I did not go to the pool so I'm not sure the quality of the pool. Pillows at a BW could always be better than they are.	3.0

The rooms are HUGE. Parking is the cheapest I've seen at any hotel in Arlington. It isn't right in the city, but it is definitely worth the cab (or hotel shuttle ride) into downtown. Always extremely clean. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I really can't say enough. This was my sixth time staying at the Virginian Suites and I keep coming back. Love it!	5.0
The room was small. Not what was expected for 340.00 a night. My debit card was charged twice and took days to get it reversed. Manager was helpful, but did not offer any other discounts on stay even though it was their fault.	2.0

2nd time to stay at the Galt House. My son's archery team stayed there during the NASP tournament. Great facility and staff was wonderful. Rooms were great, and group price made it affordable. Food at Cafe Magnolia was excellent.	5.0
Hotel is in the perfect spot at the perfect price with the not so perfect view. Expedia rep said that it was facing the water and in a way it was but at a 45 degree angel past the parking lot and a few other obstructions. You have to stretch your neck at the furthest corner of the window to gain a peak. But it was still good though. The room sleeps like nobody's business. Once your head hits the pillows its light out. What I did not like was the front desk personnel. They really did not like there job and it showed. No eye contact, no smiles, no small talk, and what really disturbed me was at check in when I was told to sign this that's how it was put. I was like what is it Just sign - its nothing. Sir What am I signing. Oh if you have a party and smoke we can charge you 250.00(eyes still on monitor). Well sir. Tell me that. Next. Came back later that night to get snacks out of the cupboard. Over priced but I expected that but the person at the front desk was lifeless and didn't not even give me a total. She just says. Its charged to your room and kept staring at her monitor(again the monitor). WOW. But what makes up for some of the small inconsistencies is that fact that the water is in walking distance. The Ferris wheel is right there and Gaylord Hotel is right across the street. Good energy in the area and great spots to eat(Redstone) . Cant wait to visit again. Thanks for the snacks!	4.0
The room was clean, the amenities nice. Attached is one of the best diners I've ever eaten at, complete with an old-fashioned ice cream fountain that took me back to my youth. Portions were generous and the quality of the food excellent. The motel staff were nice and helpful when possible.	4.0

Everyone was very friendly and our room was nice and clean. My room had yellow sinks and toilet and a phone in the bathroom just like the 70's and 80's Vegas. Would definitelygo back. The only drawback was the breakfast buffet. Although it was given to us free for the first night the food was lousy. Du Pars was a much better choice.Thank you for your review! We appreciate it.

A nice clean casino with affordable restaurants. However, the service you get from the hosts and managers are nothing short of Unacceaptable. Being one of the newest casino in Summerlin area does not give management the right to have a chip on their shoulder. Unlike other casinos who treat their guest as if they would want to be treated, the Suncoast management don't care if one has a pulse as long as one bring in revenue to their casinos.Their compensation for players is Zero. You can be sitting there for 5 hours and end up with a 10 buffet voucher, which they will write it off on their expenses. I stop an executive host to ask a question about the table action and he purposely ignored me and walked away. I have been to this casino in the past and swear to my family and friends that I will never make the drive and step in this casino AGAIN. Suncoast management should understand that they are not the only casino in Vegas and they are not close to being the best. I would rate them bottom of the barrell.Suncoast management: Go back to the basics and treat customers well and they will come back for more action.	1.0
We had our daughters wedding reception at the Westin and it was flawless...I mean EVERYONE raved about the banquet room, food quality, wait and bar staff.they made it fun for all, even for us nervous parents! The whole wedding party and guest were from out of town yet they made us feel right at home. Between the hotel and the... More	5.0
We stayed here one night, but enjoyed it very much as it is close to the state park and very well kept. We would go back for sure. They were very nice and accommodating. Wonderful stay in all for our family of three. It would be nice for more dining options to be nearby as those are currently limited by... More	5.0
My wife and I spent a night here and were well pleased. Very helpful staff. Comfortable room, with refrigerator and microwave. An unusually good breakfast, including fresh fruit and nice selection of pastries.	4.0
Good value for money. An unplanned extension of our stay was possible at the same cost.	4.0
Bad: One person a touch too familiar / jokey at reception when checking in and out, but not really a problem. She certainly wasn't rude. Some might think it adds character. Good: Central location, nice rooms, comfortable bed. We could shop happily in the Westfield Mall right next door and In Market Street / Union Square.	5.0
This hotel is a fine place to stay. I can't really say anything particularly bad about it, but there also wasn't anything great about it. It isn't close to anything. We had to drive 15 minutes to get dinner. The room was clean, but nothing special. I saw a review that said they didn't feel safe in the parking lot... More	3.0
I was very impressed with the rooms and felt like I was in an apartment. We stayed in a 3 bed 2 bath suite as a way for all the bridesmaid to be in one place the night before the wedding. The living area was very cozy and even with five people we never felt short on room. The kitchen... More	5.0
Checked in at 3am had an early flight, the hotel employee that checked me in was rude and very unpleasant! He lied to me about a hold on my account, before he made me go to my bank and transfor money becusee my card wouldn't work then when I came back he told me that they would place a 200 hold when he prev told me that there would be no hold!! Just rude his whole attitude! Asked for a manager but was told no one is on duty.	3.0
Bad: Wish there was a hot tub after walking around town all day. The breakfast was a too expensive. Good: Great location! Room was nice and clean, very modern. There was 6 of us and we got the two double beds and pull out couch. We all slept comfortably.	5.0
Good: helpful friendly staff, excellent location, clean, light beautifuly decorated rooms, comfortable bathroom (normal shower with a shower hand! :) ), pool that you can almost have for your own use as there were not many people using it.	5.0
We stayed 1 night in a smoker room, we don't smoke but this was the only option I could select. The room was pretty dated but still seemed clean. Outaide stairs to get up to our room were a little rickety. Pool/game room area was very neat! Breakfast was good. Staff very polite and friendly. They even gave us a little bag with a few treats and bottle water when we arrived so that was nice too! Would stay there again.	5.0

I stay here about 1 week a year when I in Nashua for work. The hotel is nice, includes a breakfast buffet with fresh fruit, made to order omelets, etc. Rooms are clean and well appointed although it would be nice if they had a mini frig. Hotel has a nice pub for lunch or dinner and drinks.	4.0
I understand the whole middle of nowhere so we set our own prices but holy cow this is ridiculous! 100 for two double beds in a dingy room The only cool part was the restaurant which I was too afraid of the prices to actually give it a shot.

Hotels.com had a good price vs. what the hotel wanted for one night over the labor day weekend. This is a good value if you spend in 100/ night range. The staff was accomodating to my early check-in request, breakfast was alright, and noise level was surprisingly quiet. All-in, a good experience.	4.0
I'm so impressed. I got in late last night, and needed a cab early in the morning, and needed on time. The person I spoke with at the desk confirmed they'd have it there when needed (and I'm sure she meant to, she was very helpful). Well, staff changed overnight and the message didn't get passed on, and even if it had, apparently they're not supposed to do that, I should have called in the morning. When the car wasn't there, I was frustrated. The person I spoke with was very apologetic and tried to help, but when I realized what happened I just immediately booked an uber, and left very disappointed. Things like this are mistakes, no hotel (or person for that matter) is above an occasional mistake, but how it's handled makes all the difference. Tonight I got a personal email from their operations manager apologizing again, which was totally unexpected, and very appreciated. As if that wasn't enough, he also credited me a bunch of Marriott Rewards points in an effort to go the extra mile. Wow. I was amazed! I've had bigger things than this happen, and have just been told basically tough luck. They didn't have to do anything and they did. You could see a small hotel really caring about my experience, but generally I wouldn't expect it from a large chain (or the LARGEST in the world for that matter). My trust is higher now than it was before I checked in. Thank you. Definitely Redeemed. Other than that, normal courtyard, great.	5.0

If you just need a clean room for the night this will do. Had a comfortable King bed and a good nights sleep. The linens are not top of the line, but I didn't expect that for the price.

Bad: I really do not know how this hotel has an 8.3 rating. Room is not like the pictures. Very noisy cleanning staff. Parking is not included as the listing says.

Although this hotel is somewhat far from our travel route, US 40, it was nevertheless an excellent hotel worth reserving. The parking lot was very well lit, which is important to cross-Country travelers with a car packed for travel.	5.0

Started with front desk people getting me into my room early...excellent. Received my hot, chocolate chip cookie upon check-in...perfect. Spot was about 3 blocks from the METRO station...plus. Staff was really attentive and helpful.	5.0
Bad: I wasn't in love with the location, but it's on a main road with a bunch of similar places. Also, the payment situation was a little annoying, and I wish the chairs outside looked a little cleaner. Although, it rains a lot so I imagine the upkeep is difficult. Good: I liked how clean and spacious the suite was. It was super cute. The staff was friendly and it was an easy walk to the beach.	4.0

At check in, the staff was most friendly and helpful. There only one night, my suite was clean and comfortable. Beds were very good (wimpy pillows though). Only negative was the noise of another's air conditioning unit running for hours. That type of noise should not be heard at all! Overall, I would recommend Springhill Suites!!	5.0

Bad: I understand it is a japanese hotel but the American breakfast was terrible. I appreciate that they had all options, but the eggs weren't well cooked, the bacon wasn't cooked and for that it was expensive. there is no room service and for the hour i had to be at my conference it was hard to get out extra early to find a diner nearby. some didn't open in time. It was a buffet so super fast... I also don't eat alot of the other things they offered like the toast etc... and they had a full spread of what i assume would appeal to foreign visitors which i think is also great and nice for them. Good: it was very conveniently located to my conference across the street... Not the most luxurious hotel but certainly perfectly fine for me to attend conference across the street. The double tree down the road much more beautiful, but also much for expensive... I would stay here again as long as i could find a decent breakfast nearby. Staff very pleasant.	5.0
The location is great. The room had some very nice touches Bose wave radio, the ability to open the window a bit, nice views, marble bathroom with a TV built into the mirror, good selection of snacks and drinks for purchase.

When there is a Colts game, parking commitments to guests are abandoned in favor of game day parking. The debacle caused us to miss a planned event. Had to check out early because the valets could not promise to bring my car on time, even though I gave them an hour's notice. 25 daily parking fee should ensure better service.	2.0

This hotel is a great stay if you're looking to go into DC. Me and my friend went down at the end of Aug 2010. Although we had to change rooms two times, overall, the experience was good. The first room had the smell of urine so we asked to change. The second room had a roach in it so again we asked to change. We weren't taking any chances because if there is one roach there may be more. Finally, the third room was great. The hotel was conveniently located near the train station, mall, and diner. The hotel shuttle was great also. There were many options during breakfast. We received small gifts from the hotel during our stay such as goody bags and treats. It was really nice to come back after being away from the hotel and find something special left in the room. That was nice. The outside of the hotel was really beautiful. I really enjoyed my experience and think that I would stay there again.	4.0

Good location to get around on foot and see Chicago. We walked to Navy Pier, Millennium Park, restaurants, etc. The lobby is beautiful. The staff was friendly.

Hotels can be pricey in Napa especially at peak times. I was coming to BottleRock, America 's newest music festival and didn't want to drive home nightly. I booked this motel right away because I knew there would be a big demand for local accommodations. The Best Western is located at the edge of town. It is a healthy walk to town. For BottleRock a shuttle picked up guests right out front and carried them back after the show. The hotel rooms are clean and spacious with the amenities you would need, including a small refrigerator and microwave. The hotel has a pool and a Denny's is hooked to the building. The hotel gave out a coupon for breakfast at Denny's. The desk staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. This is a decent place to stay. Prices fluctuate so you have to check aroundThank you for your review and hope to see you before next years Bottle Rock!	4.0
Came to the area for the holidays. Stayed for the weekend. Had no problem with the stay because we understood it was the weekend plus a holiday so therefore rates are higher.

Stayed at the hotel for one night on our last road trip. Found the staff very friendly and helpful.

When we arrived in our room around 10:30 pm we noticed a very strong odor. We tried waiting it out for about an hour, but it never subsided. We think the smell was marijuana.

Wasn't too thrilled that I had to hike up three flights of stairs to get to my room since none of the elevator were working, but then I found out from some other guests that were sitting out in the first floor hallway that the downstairs had horrible internet service, so being on an upper floor turned out to have its advantages.

Great location for us with family. There is a really nice exercise room, laundry, pool and business office. Coffee and tea are in the room with a fridge. The staff are friendly.

The room looked like it was recently redone, it and the lobby were very attractive.

I would like to thank Guest Service Manager Rena for making my stay special. I had a very nice talk with her about her career at Marriott. She was quick to let me know how proud she is of her staff. She should be, they are wonderful. From the time I checked in, her entire staff made me feel welcome and very comfortable. Emily in the restaurant suggested a couple of her go to specials, and she was right on. Delicious!! The hotel was in immaculate condition. The rooms are large and very quiet. Sleeping on the road can be difficult. No problem here. I slept like a baby. Thank you again Rena.....I highly recommend this hotel for business travel, and family travel for all occasions.Hi Tom,Thank you so much for your outstanding review! Rena is well respected for her outstanding customer service and I'll be sure she is aware that you mentioned her in your review. I'm very happy that you were able to enjoy our in house restaurant, Palettes, and found the food to be delicious. I will also be sure to let Housekeeping know how happy you were with your room cleanliness and the clean public space. We work hard to ensure all our guests' stay is as pleasurable as yours was.We look forward to being of service to you once again when you return to Las Vegas!Safe Travels,	5.0

I stayed at Aloft while attending a convention. It fulfilled all I sought. A modern and well run newer hotel away from the citys congestion well suited for a business traveler. It is a 15 minute walk to the convention center or you can take a shuttle one block away. Easy walk to the French Quarter. The rooms are sufficient and contemporary. Housekeeping was spot on and ranks high for cleanliness. The rooms start on the 11th floor so you are well above street traffic. I would suggest as others have to request a corner room with windows to avoid the cruise ship interior cabin feeling if you need it. Nice bar with specials and the rooftop pool is relaxing. Special mention needs to be extended to the hotels outstanding front desk staff specifically, Lindsey and Mark (who also worked the bar). Friendly, savvy, hardworking, and patient- they belong in hotel hospitality and deserve recognition. Their inherent superior communication skills exceed standard service training programs. I happily recommend this lodging while in NOLA!Our staff will be elated to hear of your stay with us. From housekeeping to the front desk and even the bar, it sounds like you enjoyed all aspects of the hotel. We hope to be your hotel of choice when in the Big Easy.Cheers,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations	4.0
I worked a conference here video documenting the workshops. i came in late on Thursday, and didn't have the best exoerience at the bar, but they were trying to close. The next morning, the breakfast buffet was really good for 14.95. The place is older, but well maintained. The shuttle service was great. They took me to the very convenient light rail and to a restaurant. The A/V crew was also really good and respobsive.	5.0

I was visiting the area for business and picked this hotel for its proximity to my meetings. I had some flight issues flying into California, so had to call and change my reservation. When I called the hotel I spoke with Viri, who was super helpful and very friendly. She took care of everything and had a great sense of humor. When I checked in Viri happened to be working with a few others at the front desk. They were all extremely friendly and welcoming. The coffee in the lobby all day is a nice perk. I was unable to enjoy breakfast, but it looked nice as I grabbed an apple and ran out the door to meetings. I will definitely be staying at this location if I have any future business in the Anaheim area. Management should be proud of their friendly, helpful, and smiling staff.	5.0

No surprises here, a great stay at this Courtyard! We were in town for 2 days prior to boarding our cruise and we loved our stay. For two adults, a child and a senior everyone was happy.

We have just returned from 10 days at the Aqua Ocean Tower Resort in Waikiki Beach, HI. While this hotel would not be your choice if you are looking for luxury, it is extremely clean and the staff was so friendly and helpful that we considered them friends upon our departure. There were 3 of us - we stayed in a room with 2 double beds, and had more than enough room for our stay. The location of this hotel is KEY! It is only 1 block from the beach, as well as most trolley and bus stops. It is within walking distance of the Honolulu Zoo, Aquarium and many of the shopping plazas and restaurants. We never even had the need to rent a car!! They are currently in the process of renovating their rooms. Even when you were in the room during the day, you did NOT hear the renovations being done on the other floors. Renovations on all floors are to be done in June 2007. We had the opportunity to take a look at a couple of the finished rooms. The new rooms are absolutely BEAUTIFUL! You feel more like you are in your bedroom at home than in a hotel. While this was certainly not the most lavish hotel that I have ever stayed in, it was quite possibly among the best hotel experiences that I have ever had. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family for any trips that they plan to Oahu.	5.0

Great place to stay.....for such a great rate I did not think that the hotel would be very nice...but, I was wrong it was very nice. It was clean, quiet and the beds were the most comfortable I have experienced at a hotel.	5.0
Price was a little bit deceptive...when I booked the room, it stated that breakfast is included. However, it is not included in the quoted rate...you are charged an additional 9.95 per day (mandatory) for 2 bottles of water and the breakfast, plus use of the fitness center. Since this is mandatory, it should be included in the overall rate. The room was fine but there was a funny, fishy smell in the hallway on my floor. Not sure what that was all about.	3.0
They tried to put us right next door to a bank of rooms they were remodeling - mattresses and carpet rolls in the hallway, men working until very late, etc. We were there for just one night for new years eve to be close to wineries.

It would be really nice if when a hotel is under construction, that is stated before it is booked so we can then make a decision if we want to deal with it or not.

My wife and I stayed at the St Regis for 8 nights in June 2018 as part pleasure part business trip. This was our second time at the hotel and we cannot fault it. The staff were exceptional and made our stay very memorable. The hotel's location made it great to get around the City and the friendliness of the staff made our time there very enjoyable. Janelle in the fitness centre was a particular favourite of ours as she made going to the gym in the mornings a very welcoming and friendly experience.

Our son made the arrangement for us to stay here for one night after a short staying in another SPG hotel. We were not too sure whether it would be worth the move for an one night stay! My husband was just recently out of the hospital, and still uses a walker. We thought of the problems with the holiday traffic on the Fifth Ave, getting in and out of the car, and walk up the steps/stairs.....In stead of walking up the steps, we used the elevator located inside the King Cole Bar and Salon next door. Once we stepped into the lobby of St. Rigis, our worries went off the chimney! There seemed to be a special flowery cent in the air as you walked on the shiniest marble designed floors of the hotel. We sat comfortably awaiting for the checking-in. Due to the upgrade to a room with two doubles, we had to wait for a while which was perfectly fine. After a short wait, we were thoughtfully offered to wait in another room to rest until our room was ready. The idea that the management would do that for us has won us over!St. Regis is an one of a kind classy hotel with the old world class charm and beauty. Once inside the room, we were impressed with the modern update using the computer technology, among them: the TV screen fit right into the bathroom mirror would earn a wow factor the 4 types of lightening controls located both near the bed and the entrance of the room was a plus in convenience and lacquer-like Chinese cabinet under the TV to hind the refrigerator and bar was a combo of beauty and convenience. The huge multi-plated mirrors which occupied the entire wall, and the crystals hanging on the chandelier were practically spotless, so were the intricate moldings around the ceiling and the chandelier. The decoration of the room has a luxury feel yet they are just as practical and comfortable as solid every day furniture. The shower which is a separate unit has great water pressure. The tub equipped with the hang-over rack was a perfect way for a relax soak after long walks at the Macy's parade. The marble/stone bath room is spacious and modern which again is a pleasant surprise found in an old hotel. Among those who came to stay and walked those hallways beyond the glass entrance doors on each floor were Eva Gardiner and Salvador Dali, so we were told when first were lead into our room. I must say that we felt just as welcome as any entertainers and/or artists when we were greeted by the staff. As we walked out of the room, as we got in or out of the car, we were greeted politely and warmly. People who stay here for a day or a week are lucky to enjoy the world class luxury, and those who are associated with this first rate elegant hotel appear to be happy and proud to be part of this perfect corporation.Dear goplace42, We are humbled by your complimentary review of your recent stay at our hotel. Thank you for allowing us to provide you with superior and thoughtful service and most importantly, we thank you for making us your new favorite hotel.Sincerely, Octavia Marginean	5.0

What a beautiful Hampton Inn in Napa. Great Location within walking distance of a movie theatre, gym, a few restaurants and Starbucks. The rooms are a nice size. The beds were comfy. They had DirecTv which is always a huge Plus! But the bathroom was awesome. Love, love, love the extra lighting and shelving for us ladies. The only thing I would add would be a wall magnifying mirror like the Marriott has. Even with all the amazing light it was hard to get up close to the mirror to do my makeup because of the size of the nice vanity.	5.0
It is true that you get what you pay for, the hotel staff was very friendly, but the first issue was with the AC , the hallways are like a oven, they only have 2 window AC units on each end of the hallways, when you come out of your elevator or room it is like you are getting into a sauna, ( very uncomfortable), the water pressure is very poor, it is like you take a shower with a medicine dropper and if somebody flush the toilet the water is gone until the toilet tank stop refilling, the drain in the bath tub was plug, need to call maintenance to fix it, and for last when you check in they tell you that breakfast has one type of meat in a daily basis (bacon or sausage), on my 4 days stay not even one day the meat appeared. I can said this is the worst hotel I stay on the last few years I travel. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL, NOT EVEN FOR THE CHEAP PRICE.	3.0

No cable, no hot water. Reported to staff/manager He said all of Albert Lea didn't have cable, and hot water always works...you just need to pull really hard on the faucet (which I did). No apologies, just stated we already offer the lowest price rate, and I can't do anything about it I thought I would take a chance since I was there for 1 night after reading reviews. My advice DON'T DO IT!! After a long hard day of work, a hot shower and cable is not expecting too much.	1.0

Riverwalk and downstairs bar were super fun. Good music and fun dancing. The hotel itself, however, was really, really warm (no AC in the halls) and very run down. It seemed everyone was having a good time since you could clearly hear everything. This would be a super fun place to stay and party if you're full of energy and... More	3.0
You get what you pay for...while the rate was good (I stayed from Sunday July 10th to Sunday July 17th for 502), some of the people greeted you and some didn't greet you. The outlets in the room barely worked. The mirror behind the bed is a little weird unless your into that type of thing. The continental breakfast was extremely bare, so I ended up eating out, unless you like only bread and waffles then your golden..the pool is extremely small..the location is great because you can walk the strip and everything is around that area but you have to deal with the traffic. All in all for the price it was ok, I am not going to be praising the hotel's name anytime soon..I have stayed in Motel 6 and Red Roof Inn with better service than this hotel...save up for a better hotel	3.0
When we travel to Tampa, Fl. We stay at the Baymont. This property has new owners and I can see great improvements and up-grades. At check in Alice was very friendly and helpful.

We stayed July 11, 2005. Room 627. Room was in terrible shape: cigarette burns in the carpet, upholstered chair looked so worn it was dirty. We shut the window curtain only to be faced with a large cockroach. Sixth floor, no less. Called front desk: We're completely booked tonight or I would move you to another room. Maintenance is gone for the day, so I'll try to get up in 10 minutes. 45 minutes later I went downstairs. Two people were at the desk checking in another party. I voiced my complaint and was told they were busy with a customer. I replied that I thought I was a customer too, only to be told: Have a nice night. Last time for us at a Drury.	1.0

we didn't even stay there , we had friends drive by 3 days prior to our stay and they told us the place was in disrepair , screens out and filthy. we tried to call them for 3 days to cancel our reservations and they did not answer the phone. On the day we arrived we tried to call again and they finally answered the phone we told them our problems with the hotel and they yelled to late to cancel and hung up on us . They are now charging our credit card UGH you should take them off your site deplorable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1.0
I loved my stay at Cornstalk. The atmosphere is very family-like and personal. Shay was amazing, made cookies and made me feel like family. The big chain hotels can't compete with how the Cornstalk Hotel makes you feel at home, even when your thousands of miles away from home.	5.0
Housekeeping did not clean my room. Trash was left on table and in trash can. Bath tub was visibly dirty and was not cleaned at all. Beds were made up but one bed was made up with a dirty comforter.

We stayed here for two nights and really enjoyed our stay in one of the lovely suites with kitchenette. The room was very comfortable and spotlessly clean.

The Broome is a well-situated, warm and welcoming boutique hotel in the heart of Soho. The rooms are sizable and airy, the staff friendly and knowledgeable and the location superb.

This place should be closed. It is dirty and un-safe. Upon check-in, the woman at the desk said she required credit card or cash payment up front (should of been our first clue this place a disaster) She would not hold payment until our check-out like other hotels.

Be prepared for your stay here. We found a Safeway grocers nearby and that made the stay a lot better for our dietary needs. The hotel was well run, but NO ELEVATOR. They even had a waffle maker for breakfast, full choices of on the go breakfast items. The staff were really nice, helpful and knowledgeable. But remember - NO ELEVATOR.	5.0
Good: I loved the fact that staff was very understandable and after a very tough night (shooting and evacuation of the whole Strip) let us stay complimentary till 4pm. This was really exceptional service and hospitality. Thank you!	5.0

It was a bad experience for me. The first room I checked into the ceilings had water stains, the shower walls were dirty and the final straw was when I pulled back the covers and what do I see, a caterpillar crawling in my bed. I was so disgusted when I saw that and when I called the front desk they told me I had to come down to switch rooms because they had one person on duty. So they put me in another room and there that had water stains in the ceiling and the toilet seat had stains on it and the room door had water stains on it. It was 1 in the morning and I was exhausted so I stayed that night but when I woke up I had bites all over my back so with that I checked out early and went to another hotel.	2.0
2nd time there and both times could not get a towel for every person in our group. They would not let us have them. Every day we asked and every day told they would bring them and never did.

It was our first visit to NOLA and first stay at Bienville House but it will not be our last!

Nice Suite. Very comfortable bed room with two double beds. Nice linens. Separate sitting room with microwave and fridge. Two TV's.Quiet efficient HVAC. Second floor location. Clean. Nice breakfast, not gourmet but fine in every respect. Have stayed there multiple times and always consistent. Close to airport and to Expo center. Ample parking. Good value for price paid.	5.0
The hotel was clean and neat. Staff was friendly. But it looks like a work in progress. The floors were basic concrete with no tile or carpet, the room only came with a small rug. The toilet was clean but didn't work too good. The fan in the restroom was very loud and about to fall apart because of some missing screws. The hot water took a very very long time to start coming out. And lastly, there was a big water leak in the last day that came from the ceiling in the restroom. We woke up to find a soaked floor and soaked toilet. Breakfast was good and the lobby was really nice. The pool area and the whole outside was nice as well. Now they just need to fix the rooms so they can match the rest of the hotel. I wouldn't stay there again only if I knew the rooms have had good work put into it.	3.0
The room was to hot and no remedy was offered and the service at breakfast was inadequate. At 4 a cup I expect my coffee refilled without having to chase down a waiter. (We were the second customer in the restaurant that morning.) The same is true of water refills.	2.0
Good: Perfect location, central to everything.	5.0
This location was little more than a hotel 6 at 4 times the cost. Very disappointed with the accommodations. I choose Best Western as they have always been a great hotel...not this time. There seemed to be a bit of attitude because this is the wine country There are a lot of choice...choose wisely.	2.0
We stayed here for one night on our way to Northern Virginia with our son's and their families.

The maid never came to our room. I reported this to the front desk no clean towels, the bed was not made, trash not emptied, etc. Active smokers were outside on the balconies, which is the only way to get to the rooms, day and night.

From the moment we checked in to our last minute there, the service was world class. The hotel itself is located around the corner from 5th avenue with all the great shopping your wife could possibly want. Our room was ornate and luxurious. What you would expect from a St. Regis. The butler service was top notch and at our beck and call for a cup of tea or whatever we needed. Our first night we had difficulty getting a taxi to our restaurant, so the hotel have is a free ride in their own Bentley. They will do that if the location is not too far. The concierge made our dinner reservations for us in advance. Near the end of our meal, the waiter came back to our table with the manager and said your concierge asked us to provide with our house specialty (desert), which the hotel paid for. This hotel is the standard for great customer service. This is officially our hotel for NY. What a wonderful 5 star experience!Dear Dan B,We were delighted to have you stay with us at The St. Regis New York and are thrilled to hear that you had an enjoyable experience.Thank you for your time and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests.

The hotel was recently renovated and still has minor renovations going on. Rooms were clean, breakfast was tasty, and the staff members were very friendly. Used the shuttle service to downtown which was very convenient. Will stay again!!	5.0
Once we finally found it we enjoyed the stay. Your sign is hidden behind Applebees and we couldn't find it without stopping and asking for directions. We got there early and our room was ready at 11 so we were able to check in right away. Room was really quiet and the tv was a good size. Will stay there again.	5.0

This was our second stay at this location. We returned because we were impressed with the staff's attitude of extra mile service.

We were there to just stop for a night on our way to the outer banks... although I will admit that our drive down was horrible, so we may have been more sensitive than normal, but this place had zero options for food or drinks. In addition, we were going to have our son just sleep on the floor, but my husband saw bugs all over the side wall... For the upcharged price, this is a no go in future. Will sleep in car next time and save 200	3.0
I stayed here for a couple of comp'd nights and had heard that the rooms were remodeled, so I was looking forward to it and had somewhat lofty expectations. I was admittedly impressed. The room was larger than expected, tastefully decorated, and had a great view of the golf course next door and the mountains beyond. It had a good-sized desk in the corner nearest the floor-to-ceiling windows and a real rolling desk chair as opposed to a more common wooden chair. The internet speed was decent, although I had to call support for connectivity assistance. Cox support got me online quickly. The bathroom was even spacious and had two sinks, a large tub/shower, and roomy toilet area. The whole room was just great! The housekeeping staff was fantastic, getting me whatever I asked for quickly. Check-in and check-out was quick and easy and everyone was cheerful, polite, and helpful! As for the casino, the sports book area was large and not overly busy. There was a limited amount of table games, but the common, basic ones were all there. The St. Tropez Buffet was great for the price and everything was tasty and fresh! If you're looking for a golf getaway place to stay, or just someplace away from the craziness of the strip and don't want to spend a fortune,THIS IS IT! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is for the limited amount of table games. Otherwise, it's 5+ stars all the way!	4.0
Arrived by subway, tired and worn. Met Frank at check-in. Took care of everything. Could not have been more helpful. Pointed out possibilities for dining after arrival, offered tips for maneuvering the subway. Frank stood out among all the VERY helpful and friendly staff. See you guys next year!	5.0
Bad: Appetizers at the bar could have been better. No view but we weren't looking for that. Hot tub would have been nice. Good: We got a great price though Booking.com at this awesome boutique hotel. Felt like we won the lottery. The decor in the lobby, bar and room was trendy. They have a game room with pool, shuffle board, ping pong, giant jenga, and a Wii. My boyfriend and I had it all to ourselves one night. We keep getting drinks from the bar and we had a blast. Didn't need to go out that night! We booked there because we wanted to be in walking distance of the Giants game at ATT park. Had a great time at the game even though Giants lost that one. We like the exercise room. They actually had more than just treadmills! We liked it because we like to lift weights and we were able to get a moderate workout. Book it!	5.0
Great location the staff were all extremely friendly and helpful, especially William. The rooms are clean, quiet, and the beds are super comfy. Only drawback was that the rooms need a bit of a make-over (The bathrooms look pretty out-dated). They have free (included in your room price) wine and cheese in the evening, free breakfast and at 9:00pm there... More	4.0
Hotel provides a list of restaurants nearby. this has nothing to do with the hotel, but be wary of delivery in this area, the food pretty much sucks - at least the chinese and pizza. The hotel is awesome. Shuttle will take you anywhere you need to go nearby. Hotel was service was spot on. Loved my room. Cannot go wrong with Hyatt Place. Clean, Comfy, spacious, reasonably priced. Highest recommendation.	5.0
Room is nice but everything else was terrible. First off the hallway smelt like a 1970's hippie convention. Yes I am aware that It's legal in Washington State but I thought no smoking in the hotel would also cover that as well. The worst issue was the free breakfast. The breakfast attendant must have decided to save the hotel... More	1.0
Hadn't stayed here before but had heard great reviews, although only downside was not right on the strip.

Room was awesome! Very centrally... More	4.0
Given the price of this hotel, I hold it to a higher standard than a Hampton Inn. So, that said, the good: Excellent Location! Super friendly and helpful staff! Great restaurant that just opened!

Bad: We had a deluxe double room which can accommodate up to 4 persons. We had three adults. The bed was a bit small for 2 persons and we couldn't add one more bed because of fire restriction. Good: I like the clean and simple design of the room. Beds are comfortable and the room is rather spacious. I also like the amenities. The location is also good - Bart station is round the corner and the shopping area is just next door.	4.0
The rooms were clean and beds extremely comfortable. Hot breakfast and dinner every day....dinner consisted of baked potato, cheddar cheese sause, hot dogs, salad and carrots, celery sticks every night. In addition, each night, there was at least one or more additional items - nachos/chicken tenders/etc. We arrived early in the morning and they were able to give us our room which was extremely nice. Staff was EXCELLENT. Every staff member we came in contact with was extremely helpful and friendly. Shuttle was efficient - ran every half hour.Only negativesThe pool was ok...a little smaller than pictured and chilly but the room was heated and the indoor/outdoor feature was nice. On the sunny days, outside pool was nice. The room had a desk, reclining chair and two dressers. Would have preferred a table with chairs over the 2nd dresser so we could play games in the room. Not a real problem....we just went to the lobby and used the tables there. Biggest complaint was with Travelocity. They were supposed to reserve a double bed room and booked us into a single king. My grandson was coming up for the weekend from his military base so it presented a little bit of a problem for one night. Their comment was they couldn't guarantee the room and we would just have to see if we could talk to the front desk. There were several soccer ball teams here when we checked in so there were no roll-away beds. We made do but it would have been better if they had made the reservation correctly to begin with. Will not book through them again.Overall...excellent experience. Even though there were several high school aged groups who were there during our stay...room was very quiet and no complaints with noise and everything was clean and well stocked.	4.0
We stayed here for one night in April 2011 as one of the stops on our Route 66 journey.

Even though I'm a local I stayed here with a group before a cruise. Right across from the space needle and they offer a shuttle for the downtown area. Because its across from the Monorail station it makes getting downtown super easy. New rooms with electric shades, refrigerators and microwaves. While rooms are slightly smaller the furnishings are top notch. The breakfast buffet is great with an omelette bar and lots of fresh fruits. Lobby bar and restaraunt is very reasonable and good. I'd be happy to recommend this hotel to friends and travelers as its super nice.davidgmg,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your staycation here in Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

The room was comfortable, quiet and clean. The desk staff was super helpful. They even lent me a wall charger for my phone for the night (and offered to let me keep it when I went to return it the next morning). I was given directions to a great neighborhood to run through. Wonderful stay!	5.0

My wife and I stayed at the Comfort Suites over Memorial Day weekend and used it as a jumping point for the 4 days we were there.

Bad: I didn't care for the fact that we had to keep asking for the simple things such as, towels, sheets, glasses. Had to have them clean the tub before we even step foot in it because it was black at the bottom. Had to request that the garbage be emptied. Maintenance was called twice, once for the toilet and another because the air conditioning wasn't working. I would think for a hotel that charges you IN FULL for your stay before you leave the check in counter would be on top of things making their guests happier. Good: The view and location of the hotel was perfect and breakfast was nice except for the juices... The hotel outdoor pool was nice but the bar wasn't fully stocked and the food was HORRIBLE.	3.0
Bad: Small restroom. Good: Clean room with a great view.	4.0
Not sure who to blame. Expedia, says something about surcharge in one place, another place says nothing. Real pain to realize you got a good room rate, then need to fork out an extra 50 for parking. Of course no one takes responsibility. To their credit, the front desk did offer 35, since it was 5 days. 50 is up to 14 days. Expedia couldn't do anything.	3.0
Stayed at this property while on a convention. Hotel is on an old building but nicely renovated. Noise is a problem, though bring ear plugs or ask for a room that doesn't face the street side, as the party goes on all night.	4.0
Good: The staff were professional, friendly and eager to please. It was our anniversary and a lovely bottle of wine was waiting for us on arrival which was a really lovely touch. The Cavalier bar/restaurant is super and make sure you have Liam mix up one of his fabulous cocktails! Very central location but nice and quite hotel.	5.0
The hotel was nice. New renovations, the breakfast was very very good, and the rooms were clean. The shuttle to the Metro was great. The front desk workers were not nice and unprofessional. Seemed like they hated their job. They also take 100 out for a security deposit. They said I'll get it back within 17 business days. The location is sketchy. Do not walk at night. Really nothing to do around that area unless you have a car or hoping onto the Metro.	3.0
My husband and I stayed over night, in a jacuzzi suite, for our anniversary. It was a beautiful room, very clean and comfortable. Breakfast was great, lots to choose from. The jacuzzi was nice, worked well, nice hot water, and very clean! I would recommend the Hampton Inn to everyone I know!	5.0

The kind of real coffee house which is surprisingly rare in the US. A cheery barista who clearly knew her business. Excellent capucinnos and lattes, and muffins. From the number of locals who came in this looks the place in Silverton for good coffee.	4.0

It's an old hotel. The towel service wasn't great. Almost all carbs - fattening foods for breakfast. Didn't eat it any morning.	3.0

Two positives: the front desk staff and the lobby. ALL downhill from there. Reservations did not confirm booking with Hotels.com so I had to wait at the front desk for 45 minutes while they sorted that out--the staff who helped me were very apologetic and helpful, however. The room and the annex in general is one of the worst places I've ever stayed. From the stench of the hallway to the dilapidated condition of the room, the free WiFi with no connection, and the balcony with its rickety railing and beautiful view of the parking garage and liquor store next door, permeated by the sounds of drunken kids in the hallways all night long and the cacophony of constant EMS and police sirens that never seemed to stop. If you're over 30, you DO NOT want to stay here. EVER. I will never stay here again--for the same money you can stay at the EconoLodge next door--certainly no better, but how could it be worse	1.0
Bad: Invoicing of non used items after leaving the hotel.	3.0
To be honest, at 52.78 (including tax) this was a good value for the money. The rooms are fairly clean (ish) and are a good size.

Bad: Floors need to be vacuumed much better. Finding old snack food and candy is not what I would expect. It wasn't horrible, but noticeable. On 2 separate occasions we had hotel staff come into our room. First time was shortly after we arrived. Housekeeping was confused on which room she was to clean. No big deal. 2nd time was on Monday morning, about 9:30-10AM, someone opened our door without knocking, noticed we were in there and left. By the time I could get up and get to the door, look out, they were gone. This was VERY odd and concerning. Good: Location was fantastic. Front desk staff were outstanding.	4.0

We stayed 2 nights at this motel. It was a pretty basic room without a refrigerator or microwave. It was clean and owners were friendly. It appeared that the bathroom had been recently updated. It has a pool and grill area which families used quite often. Rates were fairly reasonably for this time of year in the Old Forge area.	3.0
Very nice hotel for temporary stay with big size suites of bed and canape which 6 can sleep in.Beautiful lobby and perfect breakfast.Just have to pay 8 extra for parking. It is modern design and good bed quality.	5.0
great location this hotel was great resort wise, right on beautiful beach and grounds of hotel beautifully kept but rooms were very tired looking, clean but outdated. Could do with a make over. About a 15 taxi ride from middle of ocean drive, South beach.	3.0
Beautiful property located right on the water. Tiki bar was awesome! Live music and great drink specials. Breakfast buffet was a little disappointing. The rooms are clean and the decor is nautical themed.	5.0
I checked in and this room was literally disgusting. We checked in, and checked back out in 10 minutes. I could never sleep at a place like this. The room smelled of mildew and cigarette smoke. The bedding was stained and not fresh. Please go to another hotel, this one is not worth the hassle.	1.0
The room was nice although a little bit small. The employees were very nice. It was really nice to have snacks, sodas, coffee and water at all times. The price was really good realeated to the services. I definitely recommend it.Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for your recommendation. I am happy to know you enjoyed the complimentary amenities as well as the staff services. Please come see us again!	5.0
Our party of 4 adults and 1 child had plenty of space to spread out and be comfortable in the spacious 2-bedroom suite. Friendly, courteous staff. Excellent amenities, including executive putt-putt course, TV club room, 24-hr convenience shop, and business center. Good breakfast and complimentary internet was a plus. An all-around pleasant hotel stay.	5.0
Stayed for 4 days here. The Amenities are awesome. The staff were friendly. The only thing negative during my stay was that I lost money from gambling. The beer was expensive here. Otherwise the whole experience was exceptional.	5.0

Staying over night with a few ladies (co-workers, friends) while attending a multi-day convention. This room was perfect for our needs. A king, a queen, a sitting area with pull out couch made everyone comfortable. Two bathrooms allowed everyone a little more time to get ready for the next day. Kitchenette was convenient to make an instant oatmeal for the next morning. Very comfortable beds. Complimentary purified chilled water near the elevator was a nice touch.Thank you, Chris9767 for choosing the River Hotel.

We appreciate you taking the time to post a review and look forward to welcoming you back soon.Kind regards,	4.0
The staff was very friendly and helpful! Some of the furniture is worn and needs to be replaced. However, the hotel is very clean. All in all I would say this was a good value, close to everything, lots of shopping and restaurants and only 10 minutes from the Inner Harbour.	4.0
The hotel reminded me of a boarding house. Bedrooms were tiny, as was the ensuite bathroom. There is no elevator for the hotel, so it won't accommodate handicapped guests. The breakfast room is adequate and the breakfast was bare-boned (1 type of bread, 2 types of muffins, apple, oatmeal, yoghurt, granola) but fresh, and self-serve. The hotel is older, but... More	4.0

We have a 3rd floor room Mountain Side View facing Ala Wai Blvd. The Blvd. Creates noise constantly 24/7 with loud music, loud motorcycles and cars because it is a very busy street.

This hotel was fantastic. The hotel is clean and organized. The staff are very helpful, patient and know their jobs well. I was on my own with my son and the staff recommended top places to visit, as well giving me suggestions in saving some money too.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone. We had a wonderful time here and the memories we made are precious.

Friendly helpful staff with the exception of breakfast staff. Beds are comfortable and room was clean. Dissapointed the hot tub was broken and the pool was freezing cold. Not a bad stay,but not up to a Hilton property standard.	4.0
Room was very clean, staff was friendly, continental breakfast included. Did not have any extra outlets for charging electronic devices. This may be resolved as the staff took our advice to install an outlet extender that was screwed in so it could not be taken from the room. Overall a nice stay for the price.	3.0
It was the worst experience. We booked from hotels.com but the motel employee did not update the status of the room and we got the room didnot have hot water for shower.w hen we call to front desk they said they knew it and still they have us the room. No responsibility at all.	1.0

We stayed in a two bedroom apartment during our stay in Anaheim in June 2004. We have two young children (3 and 5). The apartment was clean and well equipped. The beds were comfy and the linen fresh. We loved the location, near Dennys, Starbucks, Panda Express and Mc Donalds. We made our booking on the net from Australia and found our requests had been answered perfectly. ( A corner non-smoking room). Another great feature was the free parking and free shuttle to Disneyland. There were three T.V.'s all having cable, which the kids loved. There was a bath, lots of towels. I highly recommend this hotel to families with young children, we were very impressed.	5.0
Best decent hotel in the Tampa Area, if youre looking for high star not too pricy hotel than its worth the money, they also have two pools and great food for their guests to enjoy etc ...nice area, cool hotel overall	4.0
I stayed 4 nights while attending a conference elsewhere in the D.C. area. I was looking for reasonable price in the D.C. area and proximity to the Metro. The hotel met both needs. They provided a complimentary shuttle to the Metro (although I chose the 20 minute one time just for exercise). There were several good restaurants nearby. I enjoyed the fish restaurant nearby very much. I also chose fast food one night -- all within walking distance. I plan to stay there on a subsequent visit. I enjoyed the complimentary eggs and sausage each morning. (They had cereal also.) They are a little weak on facility maintenance but the room I had was fine.	4.0
the hotel is close to subway station, the room is large,the service is good. the hotel can free park, so it is easy for people to come there, the hotel's free breakfirst is ok,and the hotel's wifi is good	4.0
The hotel common areas look dated and worn. The room had an odor similar to old, rancid grease, especially in the kitchen. Some of the electrical outlets in the room did not work. There is no accomodation for a wheelchair to enter thru the front door. Not sure how they have avoided making the hotel wheelchair friendly. On a positive note, the bed was comfortable and the bedding was cozy.	1.0
Our go-to place when visiting family in UT. We've stayed at several hotels in Salina within a mile of I-70, and this is the best value.

A very old hotel with old smelling bath tower and bedding fixtures refrigerator is only available upon request but came with broken temperature setting control knob and old floor carpet was not very cleanly vacuumed. The A/C works but noisy it would better be turned off if you preferred to have a quite sleep. The Complimentary breakfast is very good.	3.0
The hotel played loud music in common areas which were audible in the rooms as well. I called down at 1 a.m. to ask that the music be turned off. The receptionist was extremely apologetic and turned it off right away - but I was told that they generally keep it on all night.	4.0
Good: The hotel was great I loved the room the bed was super clean and comfortable and so was the bathroom.

Pleasurable stay other than terrible internet service. Place was clean and in a very good location. Transportation was easily available. Rooms were quiet and special rooms in the hotel were easily accessible. A nice touch was a filled ice bucket when the bed was turned for the night.	4.0
The public areas of this property are relatively well maintained, and the staff there are friendly and efficient. Oddities: 1. The layout of the room--The beds were very close to the door, so it was impossible to ignore the noise in the hallway that went on all night. 2. Housekeepers expected to clean the room while we were in it. 3. Hotel staff knocked on the door at 10pm, and insisted on entering the room to exchange a new phone book for the old one in the room, even though we told them the children were sleeping. Very strange.	2.0

My stay here was very nice, the staff were nice, the hotel was in great condition and had great views to downtown. Very reasonable pricing also. My only complaint is that we did not know ahead of time that all rooms do not have a refrigerator. I was informed that only the executive king suites have refrigerators. Lucky enough for us we brought along an icebox and was able to keep everything cold. All in all I would recommend this hotel!	4.0
Since we had a 7:55 a.m. flight to the West Coast, leaving from in an unfamiliar area, we chose the Virginian based on its proximity to the airport. The check in was easy, the printed directions to get to Reagan Airport were concise and re-explained verbally.	5.0

...without the hassle of being downtown. Nestled in San Marco one block from Hendricks Ave., this cozy little hideaway is well worth looking for.

We decided Saturday morning to go to A.C. for the night (from North Jersey)... looked online for a hotel that was reasonably close to boardwalk and casinos and priced below saturday night casino rates... this hotel fit that criteria... 2 blocks from boardwalk... essentially between resorts and ballys... good location (although other reviews are right about strip bars on street between boardwalk and hotel)... hotel is older and no frills - but clean, comfortable (air conditioner in our 4th floor room worked great), and certainly adequate... i would certainly recommend this hotel as a reasonably priced place to spend an overnight	3.0
Our room was very nice and very clean. Stayed in a suite which offered very nice full kitchen options along with a gas fireplace.

Bad: Very noisy at night (24h party directly below the rooms in the other building, traffic). We didn't stay in the main building, we weren't informed before. So please check before, otherwise there's not much sleep possible. Good: Next to Ocean Drive, so the beach is over the street. Room was huge and clean.

I had a surprisingly disappointing stay at what I thought was supposed to be a nice hotel. We were moving apartments close by, and I booked a 3 night stay. The service was almost non-existent. We asked for a crib before check-in, then again three separate times after we checked in. It finally arrived after 11 PM! We asked for silverware so that we could eat our room service. Never brought it. We ended up eating with coffee stirrers in the room. No one offered a smile or hello, or offered to open a door when I was coming through with a stroller. The rooms are very dated. Overall, just a very disappointing stay. It seems like this hotel is just resting on a famous name.Dear LK198200,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

Clean room and public areas, updated colors and design. Good full American breakfast (scrambled eggs were very fluffy, not soggy and runny). A 5 glass of wine at the lobby bar was extremely reasonable. Hotel had several motorcoach groups there, but the front desk seemed to process their check-in/check-out very efficiently. All staff very courteous and friendly. Hotel shuttle runs to the metro stop, so you can easily get into D.C. without driving. I'd stay here again.	5.0
This hotel was located right off the interstate. Signage at the hotel was not visible until after you passed it. The hotel staff was very polite and accommodating.

I had planned a last minute trip in to Anaheim to go for a Birthday event at Disney, the entire city was sold out but Townplace had a few rooms available. We generally dont stay this far away from Disney but we had no choice. Room rates were out of control because of a conference and most hotels were sold out! I have to say we were pleasantly surprised with the hotel. My experience at check -in was fantastic, the rooms were clean the energy was good and overall we didn't care that we were a few miles away from Disney. We Were happy with our stay. The only thing I could say that I was not crazy about was the commuter train that passes through the back of the Hotel. Other than that I would recommend this place to any of my friends or family membersWe appreciate your business and value your honest feedback.

My wife and I loved this hotel. Our large room was beautifully decorated...with a super comfortable bed. The ambiance of the hotel I would describe as urban chic boutique-style luxury art gallery hotel. The location is wonderful for exploring the charming neighborhood and nearby downtown. The service was excellent. Brunch was delicious in the charming restaurant. Bottom line - it combines a fun, happening atmosphere with a great stay. I doubt we'd look anywhere else in the future. This is the hotel of choice.Hi Doug K,Thank you for your kind words! We think you're pretty great too! We hope to see you again soon.Thanks!	5.0
This Hotel was very clean and very convenient within walking distance to all attractions and to the Cruise Piers. They are located directly across the street from the Space Needle so our view from our window was spectacular. Would recommend this to anyone visiting for a few days prior to going on a CRUISE. Also close to the Monorail that will take you into the city.reneeo784,On behalf of the staff, we truly appreciate you choosing the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown. Your comments about the cleanliness of the rooms and unbeatable location next to the iconic space needle and Seattle Center has the team proud to be members of the hotel. We hope you can join us again for your next trip into Seattle!Sarah Junge	5.0
Very clean and friendly, enjoyed the room and comfort level it provided. Free continental breakfast and complimentary internet is always a plus, highly recommended for people visiting the Yorktown area as it is only around 10-15 miles away.	5.0
We decided to book this hotel for a weekend stay-cation. We are from the Dayton area and knew the miller lane area had plenty of restaurants for our getaway. We have stayed in the south location by the Dayton mall and always enjoy our service, and the room... However, this location seems less organized and not as up kept. The employees parked wherever they wanted, maintenance trucks taking up half the parking lot (not even in spaces) and making it difficult since it was a one way driveway. Also, the bed was VERY hard and uncomfortable, I almost preferred the sofa pull out mattress. Our mirror was cracked, which wouldn't have been a big deal if we didn't have a toddler trying to touch it... And the tub was clogging when we showered. Also, the stove kept randomly turning on.. Yes seriously.. Just clicked on. Our sink faucet had a steady drip as well as the bathroom cold knob did not turn (but the hot water also never got hot).	3.0
The Mills House is just lovely. The rooms have upgraded bathrooms and wonderful bed linens. Very quiet. The dining room needs some attention when it comes to service and the food is up to the restaurant standards in the area but that is a small complaint.We would go back again.	4.0
Lovely large rooms,comfortable beds,located very near big Westfield shopping mall. House bar is a bit small and lacks atmosphere would be the only let down. Value for money ,newish hotel in a city where the hotels are old and run down	5.0
Stayed here for 3 nights on our way to Marco Island having never been to Longboat Key before. So glad we chose this resort, all the staff were so helpful and friendly.

This hotel certainly keeps with the Ritz Carlton name. Great surroundings. great service, and great food all made for a relaxing stay.	5.0
Bad: The elevator to the parkade requires some maintenance - at least a wet mop to kill whatever is lurking on the floor!. Good: This resort hotel is amazing - the location in perfect, the rooms are huge, and absolutely spotless!	5.0

On a visit to San Francisco my husband and I decided to take a quick over night with friends to Napa and ended up at Inn at the Vines. The hotel is a little older but in pretty good shape. Our room was large and clean enough! The location for us was good. We enjoyed the breakfast in the morning.The poor girl checking us in was alone and pretty darn busy. She was great though!! We would certainly recommend the hotel for anyone staying a night or 2 in Napa!!Thank you for your review and compliments on our hotel.Come back and see us again.	4.0
Very happily surprised :-)! Emerald greeted us with a great big smile and patiently waited while I rearranged my wallet to find my AARP card and got us booked into a beautiful suite.

As said in the title, I don't have a single negative thing to say about this hotel. Every member of the staff was as nice as can possibly be, rooms are nice housekeeping does a great job, and the complimentary breakfast AND dinner were delicious. Not to mention the complimentary dinner includes (3) drinks. Great location right by the airport easy in easy out, and there are some great restaurants within walking distance.	5.0
Bad: Nothing. Good: Quieter compared to the strip hotels	4.0
Ok, the room was clean. Spacious. Weird design where the bathroom door was a slider Desks attached to the wall covering the electrical outlets Appliances not plugged in...the refrigerator! No light bulbs in the fixtures Cleaning service doesn't remove the used coffee grounds	3.0
I enjoyed my 3-night stay here. I was given a nice room the continental breakfast was first rate. There was some trouble with one of the elevators, and the room was overly perfumed, but the staff were friendly and helpful.	4.0
They double-charged us for valet parking. For 2 nights we paid over 260 and they have yet to reimburse us. Expect to wait over 45 minutes to have your car fetched from the valet and pre-arrange for them to retrieve it before check-out.	2.0
Very clean and quiet. Seemed like a newly built or renovated property. Good breakfast. Nice location. Convenient to Glocester and Mathews. No complaints at all. I would definitely recommend this location.Thank you so much for your recent review of the Hampton Inn in Gloucester! We are so pleased that you enjoyed your stay and we are delighted that you would stay with us again!! We look forward to seeing you soon!	5.0
Should have checked Trip Advisor before staying here. Besides being dirty there were holes in bed linens, paint on floor and door handle, tub wouldn't drain and TV had no signal. The worst motel we have stayed in.	1.0

Great hotel, excellent service from staff including front desk and the restaurant. Breakfast was a fair price and had many options. Food was excellent. Wait staff paid excellent attention to customers. Knew what they wanted for refills and such. And as I'm diabetic, I loved that they had sugar free stuff available. That impressed me a lot. What also impressed me a lot was the option of fruit as a substitute for fries with dinner. Never had that before. Front desk staff were very attentive and helpful. It was near enough to the colliseum, but the hotel and the colliseum are in a kinda tricky area to get in and out of. Nice area, just tricky to navigate. Would recommend to others and would definitely come back again. Rooms were comfy and beds were comfy too. Only complaint with room was very noisy air conditioner or fan or something in the room. All in all great hotel for a great price.	4.0
"We were in Kansas City to see ""Once"" at the Kaufmann Performing Arts Center and decided on this hotel for a good location, near the venue. We were beyond pleased with our stay in the Sheraton. The hotel is classy and the area is vibrant. So much to take in and appreciate. Our stay was a ""5"" across the board."	5.0
Bad: The room we had was situated next to an electrical room, which was noisy and loud throughout the night. We did not have a refrigerator for our drinks, and we asked manager re: both. She said she would take care of the problem. Unfortunately, she did not bring the refrigerator or move us to another room. We should have at least had our room charge reduced, but t no avail. I told the hostess when I gave my keys about the problems, all she said was, I'm sorry.. Good: Location, proximity to US 60 and downtown Williamsburg	3.0
We really enjoyed our stay. The hotel staff the shuttle service was fantastic! Only a couple of minutes away from a Metro Station the hotel provides regular service to/from every 30 minutes or on demand. Very nice buffet breakfast. Hotel room was clean very comfortable. We will definitely be back.	4.0
My wife and I spent our first anniversary here and loved it! The staff was incredibly kind and everything was clean and more than comfortable! It was only 45 minutes from Asheville so we spend the day in the city then drove back up in the evening. Cozy and warm, this place was amazing!	5.0
Breafast was awesome. Only complaint was how small the bathroom was. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept on. My sister in law and her husband had room beside us and they said the same thing about the bed. Would love to have that bed just wish I had looked to see what brand the bed was. Everyone was very nice to us. Had an issue with the bill at checkout but they promptly took care of it. Thank You Best Western for a wonderful 8 day stay.	4.0
The hotel was just okay. They are under construction and the location has quite a bit of road noise. The room I was in had and older bed and the bathroom could have used some updating. One good thing was the bathroom was clean.	3.0
Very friendly, a true honest friendly. Nice room. Fantastic breakfast. Very clean. It is not a chain hotel so maybe that is why the employees seem happy. That is a good reason to stay here. Easy to get to from the freeway.	5.0
Bad: The cleanliness wasn't the best. One of our towels and bed sheets had red stains on them which the staff informed us was rust, and not blood....upon arrival the toilet wouldn't flush as well. We got stuck in a smoking room even though we didn't book a smoking room. The noise was unbearable, and when combined with the smoke just added up to disaster. Good: Close to the public transportation systems. In the middle of downtown Las Vegas.	2.0
Beautiful hotel! The corner suite is very tech savy and modern! I like the separate living space and bedroom. I also love how everything in the room can be controlled by one device! The monorail also stops here which is a plus! Overall, it can be pricey, but it's worth it!	5.0
Red Roof Inn is 100, smoke free, but that doesn't prevent people from smoking right outside their doors and therefore talking every hour in a half outside your door too and the smell of smoke that surrounds you every time you walk out or in. The room is what you pay for, location is right off the highway so convenient, it is 10 to 15 minutes away from everything.	3.0
Good clean room. The swimming pool is surrounded by the hotel (in the middle of the hotel), so people from the street can't see our activity Jose, the guy in the front desk was very helpful.

This had to be the nastiest place I've ever seen. Once you get past the tobacco spit on the walls and stairs, the Walmart shopping carts, and the dirty stinky clothes hanging on the hand rails you make it to the room.

The check-in process was a little lengthy, but staff was pleasant. The rooms are nicely appointed with high tech touches like a tablet to control the drapes, music, temperature.

My son is a student at Salisbury University. I have stayed in several area hotels but the Hampton Inn in Fruitland is my favorite.

Stayed at Blue Harbor because my spouse had a work meeting there this weekend. We thoroughly enjoyed the bright and clean rooms. All the staff was friendly and accommodating.

Power went out due to a snow storm however, partial power was available. Light bulb was burned out in the bathroom though (unrelated to power outage. Hotel is very difficult to find, but the staff were courteous when I called for directions. TV cable is on satellite and most channels were not available due to the storm. Surprising that they're not on standard ground cable. Internet was lost as well due to power issues. Hotel was clean and nice, but dated. Exercise room is small and dated. Bar service was very slow and inefficient. Hotel did a good job clearing the parking lot and sidewalk of snow by morning. However, it would have been nice to have some help to open the sliding doors while carrying all my stuff to exit the hotel, which were difficult to open.	2.0
This is such a great hotel! The staff are exceptional and go out of their way to be helpful! A great place to put your feet up to relax. Rooms are clean and spacious! It is close to shopping, restaurants and the airport. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WHO IS COMING TO FORT MYERS!	5.0
In most categories, we loved Deer Crest. The rates were reasonable.

If I knew how far away and the sketchy neighborhood this hotel was, I never would have stayed there. There is nothing but fast food in the area and walking after dark is questionable. The room smelled of cleaning chemicals, the wireless service was weak, and maintenance did not come when called. No hairdryer - had to call the desk for one. Toilet paper holder falling off wall. They did a good job making this hotel look good in the pictures, but it was run-down. The van did come when they said it would, but be prepared to wait a long half-hour if you miss it.	2.0
I stayed here for one night for business. I am a Marriott person myself, but was pleasantly surprised! I would compare it to a Marriott Courtyard!

The hotel was just ok. I picked this place for the advertised free parking. Unfortunately, the parking area was small and not near big enough to hold the guests cars.

The hotel was easy to get to with smiling welcoming staff. The room was Clean and ready for use. I'll return there when in town again!	4.0
My stay was surprisingly wonderful, except they didn't mention any charges at check in after the bill was paid for ahead of time. If they're going to charge customers after they've already paid ahead of time, then they should at least give the customer the common decency and respect to advise them of such action. People don't like surprise charges and no legit reasons.	5.0
The gentleman at the front desk was so friendly and the shuttle driver treated me like a queen! They made my stay wonderful and are the main reason that I will stay again at this hotel!	4.0
While nice looking on the outside and in the lobby the rooms leave much to be desired! Upon checking in we spent the next 15 minutes chasing and squishing black bugs around the floor. The mattress is very old and worn down, quite lumpy with the edges collapsing.	2.0

Such a good trip. Being there with my fiancee to enjoy a little getaway for the weekend was perfect. We couldn't believe the view. The sunset was phenomenal and you can't imagine the sunrise. I just wish we were able to have free-wifi. Sucks to pay but they want to make a profit right Other than that the amenities sounded so great. A free bike, shuttle to downtown, and 24 hour pool. I guess that's where the extra income from the paid wifi goes too Whatever. It was sweet. We loved it and loved how friendly the staff was. They truly care about you and are always ready to help.	5.0

When I first got in the room I didn't remove my jacket because it was so cold. The room takes forever to heat up. The blankets are very thin. They are actual blankets, not your typical hotel comforter. This would be okay IF the room wasn't a freezer. - This hotel does not care when you have issues with things which is unusual but at least other hotels try to improve your experience. - I got sick because the room was so COLD and since I had a sore throat the next morning I called for a late checkout and of course they couldn't do it. Other less important things: TV movie ordering did not work and when I called the front desk they said they would send someone and never did	1.0

Not the most restful hotel in the world. The air-freshener made a bleeping noise every 82 seconds and the front desk didn't even try to fix it, preferring to let it bleep through the night. Then room-service banged on my door twice even though the do-not-disturb sign was on the door. Wi-Fi bandwidth -- was great, room was clean.	2.0

Very convenient location. Hotel very convenient for traveling in New York City. Recently renovated, very comfortable and clean beds, modern furnishings (LCD TVs), granite counter tops in bathrooms. Good price too! Taking the bus from New York City to the hotel takes only 15 minutes. The commute in can be a little longer, up to an hour, so leave lots of extra time traveling into NYC. The Wal-Mart next to the hotel was very convenient for last minute things. Would return next time I go to NYC. The hotel restaurant never seemed to be busy though, even at night.	5.0

Bad: My preference for a mattress is more on the harder side so my back was rather sore in the mornings after waking up. But it seems like most American hotels have rather soft beds so I am not sure if this is something that bothers other people or not.	5.0
Although there's no special amenities, it is clean and more than affordable. Typically we are out shopping when visiting the area so we spend little time in the room. If you are just looking for a place to lay your head and use the money you save for shopping, this is your place!! :)	4.0
Nice place to spend the night. Very close to car rental.	5.0
Bad: Room walls are incredibly thin! Ambient noise from all around! I heard my neighbor sneeze, and I felt horrible coughing at night for fear of disturbing other floors! Parking and walking to the room was long and difficult with many bags. Limited hotel parking with expensive rates. Public parking becomes the only option, and while not as terribly inconvenient as you would think, it would still be nice if Miyako had their own, larger facilities. Good: Amazing location, and very cool bidet feature in the bathrooms. Spacious size rooms in the executive suites for the price value. AC kicks on very fast and cools the room nicely. Great views from floors higher up.	4.0
Bad: We were on the 9th floor and slept really well but could hear the metro. Earplugs are supplied which were useful to my husband. There were two tvs in our one bedroom suite but only one remote control - odd when we wanted to watch two different shows. Good: Absolutely perfect location in Chicago, within one block of the metro, walking distance to most of the top areas to visit and very good restaurants. Very comfortable room and bed, neat layout for the closet and vanity, wonderful shower, cool design features (Vespa chair, red fridge, furniture).	5.0
We have stayed at this hotel twice in the last year and we love it. Conveniently located -- 10 to 15 minute drive to downtown - close to shopping (Whole Foods) and a great restaurant - North by Northwest. We come to Austin to visit our son and are very pleased with the amenities that this hotel has to offer... More	5.0
The location is very, very inconvenient, but I am sure that is nothing they can help, it is just how the city has grown around their location. I would have rated the room as a 4 or 5 for clean if the sofa was not so disgusting. I literally covered it with a sheet just to sit on it. There was not one inch of surface that was not covered with a greasy/dirty stain. I would have switched rooms if I hadn't already unloaded all of my stuff in the rain before I turned on the lights to reveal the nasty sofa. Otherwise, the room was clean and comfortable. It would be worth a couple of hundred dollars to get a steam cleaner and clean the sofas in each room. Not to mention how unsanitary it is.	4.0
We stayed with our two large dogs in the unit with the kitchenette. It was actually a very large one-bedroom apartment! Located above the office, it had a partial view of the ocean. Even with the two big dogs, we probably didn't need quite that much room. Great walking trail that the dogs loved just steps away. Office gave us... More	4.0
The Brentwood Lodge is conveniently located. Staff was friendly and helpful. Cabins were very clean and comfortable. AC worked great, and great circulation if you would rather have the windows open. Water was a little smelly. They need to install better filtration or something. Units were a little light on storage space. I don't mind living out of a suitcase... More	4.0

We were looking for a low cost motel in Kings Beach for a weekend of skiing at Northstar.

I visited the Suncoast Hotel Casino in Las Vegas last weekend and was pleasantly suprised. The rooms are clean and the rates are great!I live in Las Vegas for my second home, and many times I bring friends to gamble here in Las Vegas. They all can't stay at my home, so we usually look for a local hotel and casino to stay at that is affordable.The Suncoast had great restaurants, clean rooms and winning slot machines at a low price.The only drawback I had was that as a non-smoker, the casino needs better ventiliation. It was very smoky in the casino area.Highly recommended!William Mahoney	4.0

Had a really lovely time at Seacrest oceanfront.

The sweeper hadnt been ran in our room when we got there. We had to turn AC down to 63 to get it cool in our room. And you had to duck to get under shower head. The mattresses were awful. The sheets were clean.I'm sorry your stay wasn't up to standard. I will work hard to resolve these issues. Thank you for your honest feedback.	3.0
I was very disappointed in this hotel. It was not what I expected since it was to be renovated. It took me about 20 minutes to find the entrance. I arrived late at time and a sign with a red background and red lettering was not a good thing. When you add in poor lighting, it definitely was not a good mix. When I checked in there were a few peopled in the lobby and outside. this raised safety concerns. I obtain my keys and receive directions to my room. Again, more people hanging outside. I enter the room and realized the mistake I made. The room was very small with no iron, ironing board or coffeemaker (most hotels provide these basic items). I read the booklet and I learned to enjoy these benefits, I would have to upgrade which I began to think it wouldn't be worth it. The next morning I left the room and there was woman sitting outside in a lawn chair. I returned 3 hours later and she was still there. If it couldn't get worse, when I returned later that night, two men were sitting outside a room, in lounge chairs, music playing and a small grill on the grass. At this point I was relieved that I was leaving in the morning and this would be a distant memory very quickly.	2.0
I was going to be in downtown Atlanta for a convention and had to check in early. Looked at their website and called the local phone , followed instructions for 'in house reservations' (btw the voice mispronouncing Centennial is hilarious) to have our reservations confirmed.

I'm very satisfied with my 6 nights stay with the hotel. Very close to the metro. The room is huge, clean and comfortable. The kitchen with a microwave, fridge, range, cooking utensils and plates, is a plus. The staff is friendly.I highly recommend this hotel.	5.0
Nothing fancy, just a quiet room and an bed for a quick trip to Ohio.	3.0
Just needed a place to stay for the night. Nothing fancy. When I arrived took 45 min to check in. There was another person and I trying to check in only. The man at the desk keep stopping to help everyone who would walk in leaving us just standing there. Even if it was just talking to the random that were walking in. When we finally checked in, there was nowhere to park. People who had rooms on the other side of the hotel was parked on our side so we had no place to park. My husband had to pull behind someone to get our stuff out then drove it to the gasstation and asked if we could park there for the night and he had to walk back to the room. Also, there was a party going on in the next room which wasn't that big of a deal cuz they weren't loud or disturbing us but because of the party they had this man that stood in front of our door trying to sell us drugs as soon as we walked up. Everytime we walked out he kept on. I have a 10 year old daughter that was with us. Called the front to let them know of this man and the guy at the desk just laughed and said oh yea he's here often, he won't bother you. UM I'M CALLING BECAUSE HE IS BOTHERING ME. Worst hotel I ever stayed at.. and I've stayed at some terrible hotels.	1.0
We were driving from Florida to North Carolina and thought that we would stop half way. I am glad we did, this is a very nice hotel to stay in. There are 3 of us and we each had our own bed and breakfast the next morning was great. The only thing we had an issue with was the parking... More	5.0

Second, the service is... More	5.0
LOVED IT!!!	4.0
Good: The staff was fantastic and amazingly helpful.	5.0
Check in - very helpful. Room - probably as we thought from the reviews (we took a chance seeing the comments about refurbishment). Beds - comfortable in main room, pretty shocking bed settee for the kids to sleep on in the sitting area. Pool - looked dirty although we did not use, plenty of others did. Gym - very poor and should be removed as a feature (planet fitness ideal if you do need a day pass for a workout!) Location - absolutely fine for Busch Gardens. Noise - no real problems at all. Price - absolutely fine. Wifi - just about OK. Breakfast - OK. We were not disappointed as such, the hotel was OK, they know they need to refurbish, but probably need to do this sooner rather than later to avoid too many negative reviews. Our main reason for choosing the hotel was because it had separate rooms for us and the kids and it fitted the bill for this reason.	3.0
Hotel was just ok nothing special. Was down here for a party weekend so worth it. The town is amazing, because theres so much fun stuff to do there. Great many bars and restaurants.

This hotel puts Reading, PA back in the map. Great place to stay to celebrate, wedding, reunion, honeymoon, etc. Restaurant and Bar are excellent, breakfast is always scrumptious.

What an amazingly preserved, pristine, comfortable environment.! As lovers of history and historic venues, we found a home on Whisky Row. Walking in the Granite Glens was worth braving the cold.

Hotel Zelos was a great place to stay in San Francisco. The staff is definitely the highlight of the hotel. The hotel itself is great: clean, well decorated, etc, but the people who work there were very helpful and friendly. The location is great being right next to the Powell BART station but the neighborhood is under construction. This obviously isn't the fault of the hotel and won't impact your stay. We couldn't hear any of the construction, but it makes it a little more difficult to get around. Overall, I definitely recommend Hotel Zelos!	5.0
Wonderful as always, the consistent level of quality is always reassuring and so pleasant	5.0
I've stayed at this hotel twice. Each time was only for one night, however, so I can't comment much on housekeeping other than to say my room was always clean and presentable upon each check in. This last time I did have an issue with the outlets on the desk next to the televison, so I had to make my tea by my nightstand with the provided coffee maker. It would also be a great convenience if they had a mini fridge and microwave in each room. But other than those minor issues, I can't complain and would return. The cookies are delicious as well.	4.0

I stay here frequently as a getaway. It is clean, quiet for the most part. They do allow dogs so just make sure there is not a dog in the room next door. However they did take care of the barking dog next door immediately and it stopped for the rest of the night. That only happened once in all my stays.It still looks brand new on the inside. Highly recommend this hotel.	5.0
Always a friendly and courteous staff. Very good value for the money. We usually always stop here on our way to Colorado and the location right off the interstate makes it easy to get to the hotel and easy to get started the next morning.	5.0
Swiftly cleaned rooms just like most hotels. The staff are the best part about staying here. Shawn and Bianca N. are my favorites. Without hesitant, go to the moon and back to make sure you feel at home. It's hard to find that at other branches in Metro Atlanta. Bianca N. and Shawn are the Dynamic duo. Whether you need something as small as dishes to needing a laugh. They are the perfect ones.Chanel, thank you for making Extended Stay America -Atlanta - Clairmont a part of your travel plans.

The hotel was very clean and front desk service was fast and friendly. The room was a bit small with only one chair. The free breakfast was good but the plastic silverware and styrofoam plates was a bit tacky. However, I did get a great rate so I was definitely satisfied and would stay here again when needed.	4.0
Breakfast was awful the one time we had it. All of the days prior it was closed earlier than it was supposed to be. We were put in a room with a bucket catching a leak and then they moved us right across from the elevator where we could hear it ding all night. We won't stay here again.	2.0

The price of the room says it all. It is a cheap hotel room. Clean and OK to stay for a single night when you want a cheap hotel to come in late and stay overnight and get up early and leave. However, the only real big problem with the place is the smell of cigarette smoke that permeates the room!!! It is unbelievable. DO NOT turn on the fan in the bathroom and bring an air freshener. With the LOUD air conditioner on, the room becomes air becomes equalized enough to sleep there. You have been warned !	2.0
My family of four plus our best behaved child, Boston Terrier, stayed here on 6/20/16-6/22/16 and loved our stay. In fact, this hotel was the highlight of a week long driving trip through NC.

My stay was wonderful. The only thing I would adjust is the room temperature. I was not very cold.	5.0
The good points: it's relatively inexpesive, it was clean, and the service was good. The bad: it's close to a heavily used road (think noise), and its not quaint or luxurious. The brochure claims that you get a complimentary Breakfast. But what they actually give you is 2.50 off your breakfast at Dennys. This basically covered the cost of our coffee. I don't think Dennys has a breakfast on the menu for 2.50.	2.0

Stayed overnight after seeing Rascal Flatts concert. Clerk had personality of dry white toast. Not mean or disrespectful, just not particularly friendly. The elevator smelled like a sewer pipe, as if a sewer main had busted and was discharging into the elevator shaft. Room was decent size but bed horribly uncomfortable. Lumpy and right side sagged so bad my wife almost rolled out of bed a couple of times. She is a petite girl, so it wasn't weight or anything, just a worn out mattress! A couple of extra pillows would have been nice, but didn't ask for them so can't really fault the hotel there. The window to the room was literally the wrong size (too small for the opening) so a nice COLD wind blowing into the room all night that the heater struggled to keep up with. End result was room was too hot or too cold, and the heater dried out the air so badly trying to keep up with the cold blast from window, we both had bloody noses in the morning. Not impressed overall. Will pay the extra 20 bucks to stay at the Courtyard next time!	2.0

There was a slim guy at the front desk who was very friendly and very helpful (e.g.- wrote out instructions to the Metro station). The women were efficient, but not nearly as friendly. The rooms were clean. We also liked the front lounge area. Pool needed some work and the exercise room could use towels (the towels would help to reduce the smell of sweat in the room).	4.0
This hotel is very nice. I loved their breakfast. Our room was big and clean. Didn't have any problem.	4.0
The room wasn't all that I was led to believe it was. According to Ali, it was the best room in the hotel and it was big and spacious enough to accommodate myself and my 4 friends. I was celebrating my birthday. The location in proximity to the boardwalk was good but the neighborhood was kind of shady. The room itself was pretty big but the beds were small (they were full-sized beds), what hotel still has those It's usually queen or king. With that being said, we were kind of uncomfortable sleeping two to a bed. The room itself didn't get that cool as the air only circulated in the area where the air conditioning was and didn't seem to distribute throughout the entire room.On a positive note, the night clerk, I believe his name was Mahadi was extremely accommodating and attentive and we as a group appreciated that.	3.0

I stayed here with my wife to celebrate her 30th birthday. At check in, our room was not ready yet, but we were brought to the beautiful bar and given free drinks until our room was available. When our room was prepared, we took the elevator up to our floor. The butler was waiting at the elevator to greet us and directed us to our room and showed us around and how to use everything. Because we were celebrating a special occasion, we were treated to some special amenities in the form of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. It was quite unexpected and a really great touch. The room was wonderfully appointed and a generous size - particularly for a New York City hotel. The furniture was beautiful - all classic pieces from different eras... really just very well done. Silk wall coverings and beautiful crown moldings. Marble bathroom with a tv in the mirror over the sink. Quiet and isolated from the noise on the street. In the morning, we ate breakfast at the hotel - my wife said her breakfast was the best thing she had ever had to eat. Mine was delicious as well. We then took the house car (bentley service, complimentary for all hotel guests within a certain radius of the hotel) out to Columbus Circle for some shopping. The hospitality at the hotel is second to none. Really an excellent place to stay, meeting all of my expectations and exceeding some as well. This is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed at to date (definitely top 3)Dear jamGolf3, On behalf of The St. Regis New York, we thank you for both reviewing the property and allowing us to be a part of your New York City adventures and your celebration!

It was a nice hotel with a good water park for the kids. The continental breakfast was good and they had a good selection of food. The bunk beds for the kids were cheap though and a little wobbly. TV's are old tube televisions which I haven't seen in years.	4.0
Our first room had an interior door that led to the adjacent room and the lock was broken. So, we asked for another room. The next room smelled like someone had burnt a pack of cigarettes as incense in the room. We booked a non-smoking room. At that point we were just glad to have a room where all the doors locked. I would not stay here again	1.0
We checked in very late around midnight and Tanya was a gem. She was very pleasant and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable although a couple of the towels in the bathroom were dirty, there were enough for all of us to use this stay. I 95 is right out your window so if you are a light sleeper request a room on the front side of the hotel.	4.0
Bad: The room/bed were a little small and the room was quite gloomy, very little natural light and the lighting wasn't great.

Traveling on business. Check in was horrible. Not very polite at all. Nor very friendly. I specifically asked for a non smoking room.

It's been my 12th-time stay at The Nolitan Hotel, of which I call home away from home. Here is why I keep coming back: 1. The staff is lovely, service oriented and overall great! 2. The rooms are clean, new and made by the best materials and in the exact size, you need for a short stay in the city. 3. The location is by far the best in terms of distance from subway, best stores (Ayr, KOIO, Outdoor Voices, DryBar) Restaurants (Mikakus Sushi, SweetGreens and Jacks Wife Freda)4. By far my favorite hotel in the city!Thank you Daniel for the review! As always we love to host you at the Nolitan! Let us know when you will be back )Best Regards.	5.0
Booked this place to stay the night for a wedding that I was attending. It was me and a couple of buddies so all we really needed was a place to crash at the end of the night. It was fine for that. Would I bring my lady here for a romantic trip, no. But if you need an affordable... More	3.0

A trip to Oklahoma City wasnt really part of my vacation itinerary, but being from the neighboring state me and two of my friends decided to check out OKC anyway. For some reason we zeroed in on Bricktown Hotel, but boy, did we make the right decision! It was just awesome. We were kind of budget travelers, but we got more than we expected. The friendly staff and the great room facilities really impressed us, as did the great summer weather that greeted us whenever we went exploring the city. We enjoyed the complimentary breakfast too. OKC really made us feel welcome, and Bricktown was just rocking. But were it not for Bricktown Hotel, I wonder whether wed have had such a marvelous time.	4.0
This was the dirtiest and least appealing of all La Quintas that we have stayed in. The main floor hallway carpets were dirty and actually starting to lift in places. The room had old and ripped furniture and looked worn out. A simple thing like a bed skirt looked stained and very old. This hotel needs a complete Reno from exterior to interior including the grounds around the hotel. The surrounding area looked unsafe and gave us a feeling never to walk around at night. There were no family restaurants in the area.Mal,I'm so sorry that your experience did not live up to expectations. We never want our guests feeling unsatisfied or unsafe. I will make sure and forward your comments on to the general manager to make sure that this remains an isolated incident.Sincerely,La Quinta Customer Care Team	1.0
Great rooms with huge beds, but very expensive. Amazing view over the city if you live higher up. Breakfast is not included, WiFi neither. If you take the buffet breakfast (around 35 USD!), cappucino is not included (7USD), only regular coffee, which is a bit strange and really expensive in my opinion. There is an indoor pool and a spa... More	4.0

We checked in late...around 1 am. The lady at the desk was really nice and she was every night we saw her. I was disappointed with the front desk during the days. We needed clean towels at one point and were told we had to wait until housekeeping came in....which was one hour later! I know from other hotel stays that they could have at least got some for us to pick up. The room did smell a little bit musty also. Over all it was a decent stay. It did have a very convenient access to the highway heading in to D.C., so that was a plus.	3.0
We were able to check in at 10 AM. This early check in was great for us. We had sometime to get rest after long drive and could park our car and took off to the museums by subway which was about 10 minutes walk with the kids. Also, they serve us breakfast and some drinks at dinner time.	4.0

I stayed there for a week on a business trip. I wasn't looking for anything special, but The hotel seemed rundown. I didn't realize that that the corridors were external, which isn't a huge problem, but they were painting them while I was there making it inconvient to get around. The room and bathroom were shabby as well. What really did it for me though was when I packing to check out on the last day I found a small broken piece of glass tube under the bed. Curiousity got the best of me so I took it the training class I was finishing up and asked a police officer in the same class what looked like to him. He said that it was a piece of crack or meth pipe.	2.0
We drove down with no reservation on sat. Dec. 31st to bring in the new year. It's located within eye sight of tropicana and was the cheapest out of all in the area.

This hotel is undergoing extensive renovation. It is currently filled with the sounds of hammering and the unrenovated sections are seriously outdated. We had a leaky air conditioner in the room which swamped the carpeting. I used four towels to mop up one section. The management was attentive to repairing the AC, but we had a fan running for two days to try to dry out the carpet. I'm sure this will be a great place once the renovations are complete.	3.0
Not the best hotel but it was clean enough and comfortable enough. Not sure what to expect when we arrived and had to pass by someone in the parking lot entrance asking why we wanted to get through, but it was okay. Average is the best word. Won't choose this place again but not bad.	3.0

I book this travel for 2 of our employees for a 2 day business trip. Upon arrival they discovered one of the rooms had no bathroom light. When they contacted the desk they were asked what time they needed to take a shower because maintenance was gone. The staff seemed to not want to change his room or repair the light. After this employee got upset they then moved his room. This was a 10pm at night. The other rooms A/C was set to the lowest 60 and never got below 74. So the employee who was working in very hot conditions all day couldn't even cool off at night. Then there was the dinner. The employees found that dinner was two bowls of meat balls from 5-7pm. Nothing was replenished or taken care of. The signed in the hotel were wrong. Signed said vending but there was no vending that could be found. I was very embarrassed to have been the one to have booked this location for these two employees. I take pride in making sure all our employees have the nicest most reasonable stay possible when they have to travel for work. Now I am ashamed of this trip.	2.0

Toilet paper is like sandpaper. Billed for charges that even the staff can not explain and having to make numerous repeat calls to get corrected. A week later and STILL not corrected. If you stay, get your bill before you leave the property!

It wasn't our first time at this motel. We like it because it is in a good centrally located spot and is reasonably priced. They have added a complimentary breakfast room since our last time there.

Hotel is situated right next to space needle (major attraction in Seattle downtown). Across the street there is the space needle, the Chihuly gardens, the EMP, and the Seattle center, a lovely park with an amazing playground. Breakfast in hotel was complimentary and was good considering a budget hotel (3 star). The courteous and always willing to serve staff and Chef played a big role. Free 24 hr shuttle within a mile of hotel but sometime wait time is high if you are in downtown markets.Well worth it in Seattle!Devendra G,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

We had a wonderful trip at New Orleans as we are invited by Tulane University School of Medicine. Me and my spouse were extremely busy with academic commitments. The hotel is very good and near to Tulane School of Medicine. Breakfast is good and service is very high quality. The room is descent, medium size with all the amenities. Bathroom is simply superb. Room service is also praiseworthy. Only draw back is its House Keeping team. One should not keep any valuables or important materials outside as during house keeping things may be missing. One should lock all the valuables in his or her suitcase before leaving the room and kept for house keeping. This issue was serious by nature and we have reported several times on this issue. Otherwise it is a lovely hotel with very friendly front office staffers.Thank you for sharing the details of your stay. We are glad you enjoyed your stay and we appreciate the comments.

Hotel is very clean, great staff, great service. Restaurant has good food. Outside fire-pit is fun. Lots of amenities. Free wifi and Good location, near a lot of restaurants, antique shops and things to do.	5.0
Bad: As others have commented the Valet Parking at 35 per day is steep however it is known before you sign up to it, there is a parking lot close by that only charges 15 per day although not sure what they would charge if you wanted to leave overnight. Good: Very good location on Ocean Drive but away from the noise of the main area. Breakfast was ideal, plenty of choice and had the added bonus available until noon Rooms were clean and tidy and we did not find them small and we had two large suitcases in each as well as other hand luggage. Staff always acknowledged you	4.0
An excellent team to assist you. Opt for the valet parking. Nice rooms restaurant on site, front desk service available for your needs. Closest hotel to aquarium. Walking distance to Phillips arena. Well priced value for sure.	5.0
The room was nice and clean. The staff was polite and helpful. There were always refreshments in the lobby. The lemonade was good as were the cookies. The staff offered us bottled water after check in and they were all friendly.It makes our day to hear that we excelled your expectations of cleanliness during your stay! Thank you so much for your five star review, and we look forward to welcoming you back on your next visit.	5.0

We stayed at the Honua Kai in 2012 and although it has increased in price significantly it is still an amazing place. Went through VBRO and rented which was cheaper than on the hotel site.

I was skeptical about this motel, but the price could not be beat so my fianc and I gave it a try on a road trip through the UP. We were pleasantly surprised by tbe cleanliness of this motel!

Very clean, very modern Shower curtain should have been changed, it was vile, but within 10 minutes, it was changed and the staff were apologetic. Our room had a view of the freeway which we liked. The man checking me in was LOUD! like everyone in the lobby knew what room I was in, my name and my address because he was just loud, but I only spoke to him the one time so that was good. Complimentary drink coupons at check-in for happy hour at the bar were a nice touch. Very comfy bed an super squishy pillows. Very happy with the visit.	5.0
My husband and I celebrated our 1st anniversary and stayed at The Inn at Europa. Up on a hill overlooking the vineyards took us to another place far away. It was beautiful.

I paid over 190. The pictures looked nice but they were deceptive. The outside looks like a Motel 6. The rooms were nice on the inside with modern decor but the staff was extremely rude. I travel a lot, domestically and internationally. This was a very unique experience in the way I was treated upon arrival. I would not recommend this hotel. I should have either stayed at a bargain hotel or went for it and spent the 400 to stay at a nice place downtown.Melissa R - Please let me start by apologizing to you for your disappointing stay. Our practice is to make sure all our guests feel warm welcome. I would very much like to speak with you, so that I may get more details regarding your experience.

I was only staying one night stay, but have been here for work before, and this place is consistent, good every time. Only thing that could have been better was the heating / air conditioning was a bit loud.... I travel with Ear plugs.	5.0
Hotel was everything we needed. Feel kinda bad for the two women who were running the breakfast room - they were a bit overburdened at times. But they marched on with smiles and a good attitude - but especially with some items being made to order - they could use one more hand!	4.0
Bad: The actual pricing of the hotel was different from when i booked it . Good: The starbucks and how there was a gym and pool .	4.0

Clean inside and out. Comfortable, room very clean--no complaints. Typical Holiday Inn Express, Nice desk staff, usual free breakfast. One consistent thing across the chain--the coffee is sub par (but I don't blame the hotels for this, I blame corporate). Good location, plenty of dining options close by.	4.0
The hotel is clean and pretty much up-to-date. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The annoying thing sometimes can be that the heating or a/c can be really noisy. The trick is to heat/cool up your room enough during the day time so that you can shut it completely down during the night.	4.0
Bad: Nothing 1. Good: Very, Very, relaxing!!! All the ammenities were in walking distance of the the hotel.	5.0
Absolutely disgusting!!! I rather stay in my car!!! Everything about this place is gross.. including the rude staff. This is not the Tropicana and should not be promoted as if it was apart of it. I will NEVER stay here again!!! Broken mirrors, dirty towels, smelly smoky room, old food in the refrigerator from a prior guest, toilet paper was on the floor, shower was moldy, creepy old elevator that sounded like it was going to break down... JUST PLAIN GROSS	1.0

The staff was very friendly, the room was clean and a decent size for VA Beach. It was off-season, but everything was still fine. I think they are renovating the other side of the building, but our side was business as usual. The heated pool was a bonus!	5.0
Stayed there for just one overnight. The room I got smelled like a smoker room, even though apparently it was supposed to be a non-smoking room. This property has a long way to go be modernized. The rooms are antiquated and need a serious freshening. The safe in my room was missing the lock entirely. The shower/water closet room was... More	3.0
Bad: Only 2 elevators, coffee. Good: Breakfast included as well as one drink (5-8 pm), new and well kept, great location	4.0
Bad: I didn't care about some of the staff attitude they could have been a little more friendlier towards the guest at the hotel,and I think it was a little to pricey for the stay. Good: I liked how clean the hotel was and the comfort of the room. The breakfast was good as well.	4.0
Rooms were fine, breakfast was fair and reservation were a disaster. Poorly trained reservationist, said room would cost one thing and said he'd call me back after specking with management for rate. He didn't. I called back the next day he quoted me higher rate...said rate had been approved. After fighting for it, an adjustment was made.	2.0
We booked this room through Hotwire for 1 night. We paid 162. Within 5 minutes of sitting on one of the beds, our son felt a bed bug crawling on his leg.

Hyatt Place Hotels are always a wonderful option when we are traveling as a family. This particular hotel had a wonderful, helpful staff.

We dined there for dinner... More	3.0
We finished business outside Philly early and took a chance on a room at Home2. Friendly front desk had 3 of us checked in within minutes. Large, clean, well-appointed suite with comfy bed and enormous bathroom awaited us. Perfect location to walk to eat, shop, catch a train for other points within Philly or direct to airport. My flight was delayed and they provided me with a late check-out no problem. Plan to return with my family! Definite yes for anyone staying in Center City.	5.0
Good: Bed was very comfortable, room was big enough, staff was welcoming.	5.0
Bad: The parking garage was farther than we thought, was inconvenient but realize its a city and parking is always difficult. I would of liked valet service and would of paid more happily for it. Good: Yes it's small put clearly stated and really set up well. Was very fresh and updated not to mention clean. Would defiantly stay here again on our next visit. The staff in the evening was very efficient and helpful.	5.0
Bad: Bathroom was small, noisy outside. Good: Location, beds, price	4.0
Rm 314 was great! I chose this room because of the oversized clawfoot tub. It would be great for a longer stay since it's basically a one bedroom appartment with a full kitchen, 4 seat dining table and separate living room. There is no view from this room but who cares! I had a romantic weekend planned and time out... More	5.0
Located very close to SLO Performing Arts Center which was very convenient. Room was clean and appointments were ok.

Hotel and staff were exceptional. Check in and check out were a breeze. The bedding was comfortable after a long day of travel. The breakfast was hot and delicious and included choice of eggs, bacon, oatmeal, waffle, choice of pastries and beverages. The room and bathroom were tidy. I will definitely return.	5.0
Bad: The cost is on the higher end. I expected more for breakfast. Good: Great location, very friendly staff, nicely decorated rooms.Wifi good, enjoyable evening buffet	4.0
We stayed here for 3 nights in September. We arrived early and in a bit of a rush to get ready for a wedding. The hotel staff was very helpful in getting our room ready early for us. It's always nice when a hotel goes a little extra to help out, great customer service! We stayed in a standard king size room, which was spacious with a couch/sitting area.The room was quiet, we never really heard any noise from outside or from neighbors. There isn't a breakfast option, but there is a Denny's attached to the hotel and they give you 6 off per person coupons to use each day.We went to wineries in St. Helena and Oakville, the travel times varied between 20-30 mins. We ate dinner in Napa and it was just a few minutes drive to plenty of places. Overall, based on the location, price and customer service, I would recommend this hotel.Jdiddy78 - Thank you for such a kind review. We strive on incredible customer service and do everything we can to make sure you are satisfied with your stay. I'm glad we could get you into your room early to get ready for the wedding you were attending and we hope next time you're in our area you will come and stay with us again. Cheers, Genafer, Director of Sales	4.0
I picked this place because the parking was free, big mistake. I do not have anything against this nice place but I believe that i won't stay there again. The rooms are clean, the parking is big, there are many different stores and places where to buy anything around, but is also located in a violent area. It was a great stay that I won't repeat.	4.0
The overall hotel it self was was not bad. Room was average from what we've heard about small rooms in Hawaii. We had a private balcony which was nice. There included breakfast could be better.

Nice New Hampton Hotel. Rooms were very clean, Comfy Beds. Close to walking paths and down town Napa. Staff was friendly ! Great place to stay.

Probably the worst ever. Incredibly distasteful. No hot water. Inoperable phone in room. Overcharged for parking. Deceptive pricing. No bathroom in room. Discourteous staff. The list goes on and on.

We had high hopes for the Aria - during our Christmas mini-getaway we chose it over several competing hotels due to its promise of a newer hotel with great service and amenities.

This is an older property which reminded me of the ski lodges that you see in movies. The views were wonderful filled with fall leaves. The lobby had a fireplace and comfortable, cushy furniture.

We stayed three nights at the Springhill Suites Nov 19-22. I was greeted by very courteous staff at check in, a kind gentleman started the lobby fire for us and the facility was clean and most comfortable. The most impressive person there was DeCalvin Wilson. He served each morning at the delicious and varied deluxe continental breakfast and even came and cleared away our dishes in the expansive dining area. This young man went out of his way to care for the customers - I felt I was at the Ritz Carlton (or at least what it would be like if I could afford it). Give DeCalvin a raise and promotion. No he did not solicit such praise - I was just impressed and wrote his name down. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here.	5.0
Overall this is a nice hotel. However I did encounter a group of rowdy cheerleaders who were Loud. I had to complain each night about the noise but it was handled. Rooms were clean and Comfortable.

We have stayed at this motel several times traveling down to Florida and returning north. We were pleased to see the mgmt. is finally putting some effort in the upgrading the rooms.

Beware when you book online! They show you pictures of main building and facilities. I booked the room fully aware that it is not a oceanfront room and booked a 'west side' and 'room with a view'. It never mentioned anywhere in the description that west side means across the street in a inn like property, completely separate from main building. Room was not good either, with a tiny bath, more like 2 star. And as for 'room with a view', I got a 'nice' view of steps and parking garage 5 feet away from door. Talking to hotel staff was not helpful either as they offered to 'upgrade' me to oceanfront room for an additional 50/ night. The hotel should not be allowed to advertise those rooms as 3 star and put clearly in description what the west side means. Never again!	2.0
The Pier 5 Hotel is at a great Baltimore location at the Inner Harbor. It is one of the smaller hotels but size isn't important. The convenience to the harbor and restaurants is terrific.	5.0

I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews talking about rooms that were dirty or need to be updated, but we found our room to be clean and without any problems.

My boyfriend and I stayed here a weekend in July for our anniversary. Wanted to visit Baltimore but not pay the prices for the Inner Harbor hotels. This hotel was perfect. It was extremely affordable for a 2 night weekend stay and surpassed our expectations. It was only a 15 minute drive to Inner Harbor. The staff was very friendly and the room was great. Room was spacious, updated and SO clean. Felt like a mini apartment. Also one of the few hotels we found that had an outside pool. I would definitely recommend this hotel!	4.0

We made a reservation for a King room. Upon checkin, we were given a key to a 9th floor room. To our surprise, when we opened the door, it was a room with two beds. Back to the lobby we went to inform the staff and be moved to another room. The next room we were given was on the 5th floor. Upon entering, the tv was on, one of the TWO (again) beds was unmade. Carried all of our luggage back down to the front desk AGAIN to be moved. We were then upgraded to a suite in the seventh floor which satisfied me and made me much less angry. The room was very clean and a great size. When we went to the simon area at night to eat, we stood at the deal for ten minutes while the staff only looked at us. I finally walked over to someone and asked about eating and they informed me they were closing in 3 minutes. Would have been nice if one of the waitresses came over to inform us they were closing instead of just looking at us stand there waiting to be seated.	3.0

We were looking for a hotel that was convenient to the Va Beach ampitheater. This fit beautifully for what we were looking for. The only downside was that the sink had dark hair near the rim of the sink (perhaps from a man shaving) that the cleaners must not have been able to see. The staff were helpful in finding a restaurant. The icemaker on our floor did not work but the staff filled our cooler from the icemaker in the kitchen.	4.0

This property definitely needs renovation. Dirty floors, minimal cable TV, no amenities other than free WiFi (worked fine) and free parking. Everything has been used well (which is not a positive statement). Dirt in corners of room and windows.	2.0
My husband and I stay at this Hampton Inn at Easton, MD, and we were so impressed with the excellent customer service we received.

We chose this hotel because of the location and we weren't disappointed. Right opposite the music museum, science museum and space needle. Happy Hour at the bar offered a good selection of local beers and wines. The rooms weren't huge but comfortable and clean. The breakfast was buffet style and a little bit busy with everybody having to convene in a small corridor area where the buffet is served but lots to choose from. Omelettes can be made to order. Convenient to walk the short mile to Pike Place and also to savour many of the great restaurants in the neighbourhood. One negative comment is that there are only 2 elevators for the entire hotel, so you could be waiting quite a while for the elevator to come to your floor if it was first thing in the morning and everybody was heading to breakfast. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to guests.Thanks so much for taking the time to leave this review! We are so pleased to hear that you got to experience the neighborhood attractions. We are totally biased, but we think it's pretty great as well! We feel privileged to have had you as our guest - we hope it won't be the last time. Safe travels to you wherever you go - thanks again!	4.0
The location was super confusing, don't attempt your GPS. I called ahead, and they gave me directions led me right to the hotel. The hotel itself was outdated and def could use some work.

I have to say this hotel more than fit the bill for my five night stay in Phoenix. The valets were always very helpful and prompt (one of them was a hoot). The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. Two of the ladies (one in the morning and one in the evening) always asked about my day and were impressed with everything I had been to see. My room was spacious and the bathroom was a bit strange in its layout (sink extends from outside into the shower area), but it grew on me. They gave me plenty of pillows and the bed was comfy My only issue is that the walls are a little thin (or it could have been the connecting doors), cause I could hear my neighbors very clearly a few times. The hotel is located right near US-10 and is in walking distance of the Phoenix Art Museum and the northern part of downtown. Sad to leave but overall a great stay.Hi jehenson81!Thank you for sharing your experience with us. I'll definitely share you accolades with the rest of the team. I know they'll be thrilled to hear your kind words. I'll also share your feedback about the rooms with connecting doors with our design team. Next time you book your reservation, please reach out to me at mrykalskyfoundrehotels.com and I'll make sure you are set-up in a room without a connecting room. We hope to see you again soon!Thanks!	5.0

This was my fist trip to Seattle, and this hotel was in a great location. Pikes Market is about 1.5 miles away. Everything is in walking distance, or there is a shuttle that will take you up to a mile out.

We look forward to being of service to you in the near future. Best regards, Jonathan	5.0
This hotel is fresh and clean. The bath was spotless--and very pretty. No shower cap provided, though. For a newly renovated property, however, the lack of maintenance is shocking. The television emitted a sharp, prolonged buzz every two minutes or so. The thermostat was either broken or disabled, and since the windows do not open it was stifling. Yes, I... More	2.0

Bad: The hotel has no real public areas, and there's a facilities fee which I didn't realize. The reception staff weren't that helpful. The room wasn't quiet enough for a really good night's sleep due to loud aircon and some other random noise that persisted even with aircon off.

Very last minute reservation as we finished dinner and started searching for a bed near Kennebunkport. While I don't normally stay at motels, this was a nice surprise.

I love that Denny's is right beside the hotel...that is one of the reasons why my family and I had came back to stay here again on our vacation. I did not like us getting non smoking rooms when I had reserved smoking in the first place. Unpacking in the wrong room then packing up again to move in the right room made me a little upset. Most nights that I had stayed there I couldnt sleep that well because of kids running up and down the hallways and knocking on our doors and running away. I believe the hotel staff should of been montioring the 3rd floors better than they had. The air conditioner did not work at all in room 343 and it got really hot in there.I believe the bathrooms could of been a little more cleaner than what they were. I had asked for a rollaway bed and didnt get one because they were all out. I asked for more pillows and blankets and all they gave me was two blankets. Yes it was pretty close to beach and zoo and all the must see sights. Next summer I plan on coming back to Virginia Beach but I will probably rent a beach house on Sandbridge for a week.	4.0
I found this hotel to be clean, fresh in appearance, and comfortable. I would recommend this hotel. It was good to have a restaurant on-site and we found the food to be quite good. No complaints. Thank you for the stay.	5.0

stayed here the weekend of the Rock and Roll New Orleans marathon. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. The hotel itself was gorgeous, comfortable rooms and huge bathrooms. My main reason for giving 5 stars was the breakfast and inspirational note that the staff put in my room the night before the race. What a great touch.The only thing I noticed that I didn't love was that I could hear the elevators moving all through the night. My room was right behind them though so I doubt this was a problem on the other side of the hotel. I will definitely stay here next time I am in town. :)We appreciate that you took a moment to share your experience. I'm very excited to hear you were so impressed during your trip to the Big Easy! We always strive to exceed the expectations of our guests and I'm proud to be working with such a great team. Thank you for recognizing all their efforts. We look forward to seeing you again for next years marathon if not sooner, the Crescent City is coming up soon!Thank youWayne General Manager	5.0

We were in Cedar Rapids for an event at the convention center, and I originally had made a reservation at the adjoining Double Tree. However, my wife searched on Hotels.com and instead booked a room at the Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel in order to save almost 100. It was a good choice. The Best Western is located just off I-380 and was only a short jaunt (.5 miles) to the convention center. While there was a bit of a funky smell in the first floor hallway, our room on the second floor was large and clean (my wife in particular noted how immaculately clean the bathroom was). We had a microwave and refrigerator in our room, and we also used the free WiFi. The indoor swimming pool was also on the 2nd floor, although we did not have time to take a dip on this trip. There is a bar and restaurant that adjoins the hotel, and we took advantage of their 1.25 frosty mug special (daily until 6 pm). As the event that brought us to town kept us up quite a bit later than our usual bedtime, we were glad for the noon check-out time. We would definitely stay again at the Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel the next time we overnight in Cedar Rapids.	5.0
We asked in the morning about breakfast and they told us that a free continental breakfast is only served at a holiday in express.  Then we ordered our breakfast.  When the food arrived the food orders were small and not cooked properly.  For the price we paid for breakfast we could have gone to a nice restaurant in town and the food would have been better and more plentiful. Then when checking out holiday Inn charged us an additional fee.	2.0

The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful! They were so eager to make our stay pleasant. They really went the extra mile to be friendly. The problem for us was the size of the room and bathroom. The doorway was VERY small and my husband had difficulty getting through with our bag - he had to push bag in and then step in. The ceiling was very low in the hallway and the bathroom. I am 5'6 and I could easily reach up and touch the ceiling in the hallway and bathroom. We even made the comment that no basketball stars would be able to stay here. My husband is 6'1 and had to duck to get into the shower. The outside noise was also very loud and woke us up both mornings. The room we had was nice and clean though.	3.0

We stayed for New Years Eve 2016. From the minute we walked in the door we were treated like preferred guests. Abraham and Maria made us feel right at home. They were even kind enough to keep the bar open so we could enjoy a drink after a long day of travel. Paul, Lane, Justin and Jess were all fantastic behind the bar. The Shipwreck was out of this world and Paul should be nominated for Sainthood for the way he makes this drink. Overall, we had a fabulous stay. The pool was warm and with some adjusting of chairs we were able to catch some sunshine. The hotel location was absolutely ideal. We walked everywhere and there were wonderful places to eat and drink all around us. This is the place to stay in Key West! Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us.

We stayed here for 4 nights while enjoying Washington DC. I had read other reviews of Mid Points before booking so I think I had a realistic expectation. I have to agree with most of the reviews the service was outstanding, the breakfast was awesome and the fitness center was clean and spacious. The website does show a pool, however it does not exist so we brought our suits for nothing. Our room was clean, updated and repaired, but the evidence of previous extensive water damage could still be noticed. It isn't in the greatest part of town, but not as bad as Minnesota Ave. The biggest plus for us was the free shuttle to the Metro station which saved me a ton!	3.0

"Very pleased with our overall stay. For the most part, staff friendly and helpful especially the concierge. We were disappointed with the menu at the Barbados Room. We were hoping to just enjoy a nice dinner upon our arrival and were not prepared to go searching for a reservation outside the hotel after a day of traveling. After reviewing the menu, we realized there was no real ""dinner"" menu. Just sandwiches and pizza etc. What a waste of such a lovely room. And the drinks leave a lot to be desired. Pool and outside courtyard are lovely. Hotel is very clean. We did encounter some really rude loud guests who decided to continue their party in the hallway at 3 a.m. Easter Sunday. But guess you cannot do a background check of incoming guests."	4.0
We had a king suite with sleeper sofa for three adults. We arrived at about 1'0:30 pm tired from our trip only to find out there were no sheets or pillows for the sleeper sofa.

Stayed here since I was travelling alone and looking for decent rate. I paid about half the cost of the other newer motel options available at this I-40 exit. The pluses: Nice friendly staff, decent breakfast, reasonable cost, quiet. The negatives: Older property and furniture, poor room lighting, mediocre bedding and towels. I would stay here again if travelling alone.... More	3.0

First let me state this was a comped weekend stay. Ok, check in was fast and the woman was very informative on the free dining credits and October fest activities.

Located right in the heart of historic Lahaina, you can't get a more convenient hotel for the price. It's a lovely historic hotel, very clean and well cared for. Yes, it's an older building and room sizes reflect the age (smaller - but they do the trick!). Yes, some of the fixtures are a little worn in, and there is... More	4.0
Bad: The breakfast was not good. I kind of like the concept of serving breakfast in every floor, but I wish it could be more options for us that dont want to start every day with sweetened cereals and dough-nuts. But lots of places nearby that serves breakfast. Good: Location. Walking distance to everything we wanted to see.	4.0
In DC at the beginning of the Labor Day weekend, and we couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The service was fantastic from the moment we arrived by taxi, through check-in, and culminating in a turn-down service that was just the extra special treatment we loved. There were special weekend events like a family movie with tons of snacks, wine and cheese tasting in the lobby, even a magician for the kids. I loved it. The kids loved it. I would recommend highly and definitely stay again when in the DC area. The metro is right outside the front door!	5.0
The staff was great. The rooms were functional and comfortable. Not deluxe - but works. It's a bit of a trek to get to the mainland - don't be in a hurry at rush hour. But to stay at the hotel - great surroundings - and the access to the Gulf of Mexico is heavenly.	4.0
We just stayed here one night on a birthday trip to Napa. My friend picked this place to stay and for the it was nice. A little more upgraded than most Best Westerns. Bed was comfy, sink area a little small but not a deal breaker. Had microwave and iron in room which I appreciate.They do give you a discount coupon for the attached Denny's Restaurant. Skip if you can, not really worth it.Next time I would stay closer to Napa itself but for a night, this place was just fine.Thank you for your review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay.	4.0
This is a very nice place. Rooms were decorated nicely, roomy, and cool! I loved the seating area by the pool, but it does get a bit loud with all of the kids.

Me parecio un excelente hotel, a pesar de estar lejos de Washington es muy facil llegar alli, el shuttle te lleva a la estacion del tren y en 20 minutos estas en el centro de Washington, el personal es muy amable y aunque no todos hablan ingles hacen lo posible por entender y hacerse entender. El senor del shuttle habla espanol y es muy amable. El desayuno es agradable y variado. En general es un hotel recomendado para pasar unos dias, descansar y visitar la ciudad.	5.0
Fullerton is a small community 10 or more miles from the nearest town in any direction.

I am 71, have been travelling around the world all my life, and your hotel is the worst experience ever.My room has been booked through Booking.com for one month.I arrived Friday Sep 9th at 2.45 pm. I know that the check-in time is 3pm but no room was available and I had to wait till 3.15 !No luggage rack in this tiny room and I had to call three times before I got one (check the records of the Housekeepers phone)When I came back at 6 pm after having walked in the city, I wanted to take a shower. The water was cold (around 30 degrees Celsius ). The Housekeeper sent someone who was unable to fix that. So I went to the reception desk who gave me another room .The first room was on the 28th floor, the 2nd on the 4th so I had to repack and go from one room to the other 3 times THRU THE LOBBY, because the elevators are not the same . No one would ever propose to give me a hand !I gave two trousers to be washed and ironed. That was done at 8.30 and I was supposed to have them back by 6, that evening. Nothing. I had to claim them the following morning . That doesnt fit with what is written on the laundry service paper.This morning, I ordered black tea with milk in the Coffee Shop downstairs. The waitress brought me tea with bergamote, which is not a tea in which you can put milk. She had to go elsewhere to find the suitable breakfast tea, and I had to claim for sugar which was not on the table.	1.0
Our whole experience here was really positive. Rooms were clean, comfy and cosy with some fun artwork. Staff were friendly and accommodating. The food at the downstairs restaurant was delicious too and parking was really easy. Would thoroughly recommend.Thank you for this amazing review Melissa! We hope you will visit again soon.	5.0
Bad: Furniture looks old but mantained very well. It will be perfect if there is a pool upstairs. Good: The foods near Little Tokyo,even more Japanese than Tokyo city itself. The best location.	4.0
Spacious rooms, a lovely bay view and a reasonable price, but there were enough weird things that I won't be back. I did also appreciate the warm indoor pool for my winter visit. Weird things: -The light switch just inside my door did nothing, so I had to cross the room in the dark to turn on a light. -Door to the deck didn't actually latch shut, but at least it had a lock chain like on front doors. -Room keys both stopped working...twice...and had to be reset. -Elevators sometimes reopened immediately after shutting for no reason, had to hit door close again. Or were summoned to the floor I was waiting on, then didn't open. Had to 'summon' the elevator again for the door to open.	3.0
The room was very clean and spacious. Wish the pillows were Fuller and fluffy.	4.0
Incredible 2 1/2 star hotel. Things that's really standout in this hotel are cleanliness, space, and the slick modern look. This hotel can easily be a 3 1/2 to 4 star. If your staying near the domain, feel completely comfortable to book this location. I hope this place can keep its high quality and prestige for years to come.	5.0

This was my second stay at the St Regis NY. The hotel has been revamped is much more expensive bit i can't say it has much improved. On the bright side: got an upgrade and a very nice room, late checkout, the concierges are knowledgeable and get you in difficult places like the Polo Bar across the street.downsides: the Ducasse restaurant is gone and hasn't been replaced so you're left with a somewhat lame breakfast/diner lounge. The King Cole must be run trotskyists since i was refused entry before midnight despite identifying myself as an hotel guest. I duly complained and next day was served a deliberate over spicy bloody mary in what felt like retaliation. The hotel as a butler service that packs your stuff on demand. I lost i cherished Lanvin fedora on the process without so much of an excuse. Considering the price you pay you can find better options in NY. By the way i'm an SPG Gold so the upgrades and late check outs come with the status.Dear Joao C, Thank you so much for taking the time to detail your recent experience at The St. Regis New York. We are deeply sorry that we were not able to meet your expectations during your recent visit to our hotel, all of which attributed to your negative feedback.Please allow us the opportunity of discussing your comments further so that we can examine the issues which you have noted.

Stayed here in October after running the Tough Mudder race in Coatsville. Staff was super helpful and enthusiastic. Breakfast was awesome. The room was spacious, quiet, clean, and well appointed. Nice place.	5.0
Bad: Room is on the small side. I was on one of the back rooms. There are no views and other buildings can see inside your room since windows are high. Breakfast is not attended and no hot option. Very narrow corridors. Good: The decor of the room is very modern and pleasing with sound equipment for those that want to listen to music with speakers on the wall. Floor of shower is non-slippery. Decor of the bathroom is also very nice. Location is outstanding with Copley subway station accross the street as well as bus stop. Restuarants and shops in Newbury Street one block away. Bagels and donuts in breakfast were fresh.	4.0
The hotel staff was great as was the location. The only thing I'd say needs improvement is the actual building and rooms. The rooms seemed a bit old and could use major renovations. But for the price we paid with a last minute booking we were happy with the accomodations.	4.0

Hotel graciously granted my request for a different room, as I was assigned a 3rd floor room between several occupied by very boisterous girls basketball team. Teachers/coaches let them run wild until well after midnight. Unfortunately the team continued to run up and down corridors on all 3 floors.	5.0

Check in staff did not smile or greet me. She just looked at me when I walked up to the counter. Housekeeping lady had an attitude and was rude. Did not bring washcloths, towels, or extra pillow that I requested. No one answered the phone when I called several times. There was no micro fridge or microwave as I expected and thought they stated. No iron or ironing board and they required to hold my husbands ID in order to use an iron. I will never stay at this hotel again!!!!!	2.0

Wife and I wanted to stay in a hotel on the beach with smoking accomodations inside the room. We found this hotel to not only be comfortable, but very very clean and spacious. It reminded us of our stay in the residence inn in California. Would definately recommend to others in this location.	5.0
If you're not a Seattle veteran, you need to know that there are 3 main downtown neighborhoods. The old city by Pioneer Square in the south, the heart of downtown near the Pike Place market, and the northern neighborhood near the Seattle Center (Space Needle). While the heart of downtown has traditionally been the best neighborhood for tourists to stay in, the ongoing revitalization of the Seattle Center area has somewhat shifted this equation. Personally, for tourist purposes, I like the Seattle Center neighborhood just as much -- primarily because it's a little less corporate, a little more casual, and has ready access to many of the best museums (like the EMP across the street from the Hyatt). It's also only a 20 minute walk to the Pike Place market from the Hyatt House, and they offer a complimentary shuttle service, too.In this context, the Hyatt House is a grear place to stay if you're OK with the Seattle Center location. The hotel is new, and has a nice modern vibe. Since it's an extended stay brand, rooms at the Hyatt House are large. For this particular location, they also made them stylish. As a Hyatt Gold Passport Platinum member, my family was upgraded to an extremely comfortable one-bedroom suite facing the Space Needle. Breakfast is well above average for a free hotel breakfast, My only complaint was that the omelette maker was completely overwhelmed, and it could take more than a half hour to get an omelette (the buffet food had no delays). It's a nice touch to offer omelettes, but it doesn't work unless they can be made efficiently.The shuttle bus can also be a bit of a mixed blessing. In rush hour traffic, the service can be quite slow. I'd recommend walking to downtown during peak periods.Dave'sreviews,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We value the feedback from our guests and are always striving to improve our guests stay. Please let us know when you return as wed love to welcome you back as our guest.Sarah Junge	5.0

What I didn't like was the room was not good. When you walk in the hotel it looks awesome. But the room looked like you were in a motel rather than a hotel. Also the hotel was under construction from 9am to 7pm. That would have been nice to know before booking a room. The hotel staff were very polite and professional. The breakfast bar was the best breakfast bar I have had in a Hotel. Out of a 1-5, I rate the breakfast bar a 5. The staff were so on point.	3.0

We were impressed by how pet-friendly Oxford Suites was! We had just adopted a 6yo chocolate lab from Lab Rescue of Fresno, and the hotel welcomed him (and us) with open paws! They also provided a great doggy bag filled with bottles of water, dog treats, doggy scoop bags, and even a collapsible dog bowl! Our room was clean and comfortable, at a reasonable price. And the breakfast was excellent! Thank you Oxford Suites!	5.0

This was out third Christmas at Blue Harbor, last year and this year we have noticed that things have gone down hill. This year our Condo was not cleaned very well.

While the place is certainly interestingly decorated, and very quiet during the off season, there are very few amenities, at least of the sort we were interested in.

My husband and I just returned from a five day trip to Waikiki - my first time there, and we were thrilled with our choice to stay at Aqua Ocean Tower Hotel. We would definitely stay there again! As many others have already mentioned, the staff is like none other I've EVER met in a hotel. We felt like family in just a few short days. They even hugged us good-bye when we left!! Every single staff member that we encountered greeted us with a big smile, hello and answered many questions that we had about dining, directions, tips, souvenir ideas, sightseeing, etc. They offered to special order us our favorite donuts to be delivered first thing in the morning when their breakfast pastries were delivered. They set aside our favorite pastries for us while we went shopping so they wouldn't all get eaten up during the continental breakfast. We had a late flight out and they allowed us to check out as late as possible during the day and then still extended us the option to come back later in the day if we got tired to stay in their complimentary room. They showed us one of the completed newly renovated rooms, which is just lovely. It has a modern, asian look and feel to it. Very beautiful! I cannot wait to come back and stay in one of the new rooms! They said the renovations were supposed to be completed this summer, but things have been put on hold for now and they're not sure yet when all the renovations will be done. The walls are a little thin and one night our neighbor had his tv up way too loud all night. At about 3 am we finally called the front desk and they immediately took care of the problem. They went to our floor and discovered that there were actually about four rooms near us that all had loud tvs. They contacted all rooms by phone, except for one, and the security guard took care of the other room. We slept like babies the rest of the time!! Leonor, the manager, made me a beautiful purple lei to take with me as a souvenir from our trip and stay there. If you're unsure about whether or not this would be a good place to stay, I can assure you you'll be glad you stayed there. It's only one block from the beach. It's very clean and there are two Great restuarants at the hotel next door - the Tiki Grill and Wolfgang Puck Express. We ate at both places twice, they were that good and with very reasonable prices, too. Tiki Grill was a bit more expensive with a beautiful ocean view, but we just ordered several appetizers. The coconut shrimp was awesome and they had very good salmon. We had the Asian Noodle Salad at Wolfgang Puck, which also has an ocean view, but they also have great pizzas and sandwiches. For parking, we kept our car at a garage about a block 1/2 away from the hotel for only 8/day instead of 15/day at the hotel. You won't disappointed if you stay here!!!	5.0

This was the dirtiest and worst run hotel we've ever stayed in. It was so dirty we had to leave early and find alternative accommodation. Sticky carpets, dirty linen AC and fridge not working. Changed rooms but no improvement - no way could this be a 3 star hotel	1.0
Bad: Would've loved a bit larger rooms. We ended up having to get a second room for our kids (older kids) since the suite was simply too tight for all of us. My husband said the mattress was about ready to be replaced. And we thought it was funny that there was a sign on the toiletries, saying that they would charge for these if taken home. But overall, we really had a great time and loved the environment. Good: Loved the staff - very friendly and helpful with good recommendations. We loved the attached restaurant for coffee and breakfast. The overall atmosphere was very cool and well done. And the location for us was great.	5.0
Walked into this tired hotel and was put off. Once I saw blood on the carpet in my room, room 350, I decided it was time to check out. Disgusting! Fortunately, I had some helpful staff at the front desk that gave me a refund so I could run out of there.	1.0
The hotel is very near the sea...I think about 30 seconds on foot!The rooms are comfortable and clean. No luxury but very good value for money, if we consider the wonderful location of this hotel. Moreover, the staff is extremely kind, friendly and willing to help you...I will never forget the housekeeping manager, who was so sweet, and always gave me breakfast (and in abundant helping) after 10.00 am, since I was always late (let's say I enjoyed Honolulu's nightlife...). All in all, the aloha spirit is so evident in this hotel, which I strongly recommend.	4.0
As soon as you enter this hotel you notice its not part of a national chain. This is a one-off, very hip hotel. Its not just the look and feel of the place, its the staff.

We stayed here when we came to Anaheim to watch Angels games two nights in a row. It was the perfect location. It is across the street from the stadium and there are a few places to eat that range from Carls Jr to a nicer sit down restaurant (The Catch I think). The hotel provides a continental breakfast which was a pretty standard hotel breakfast. It's always convenient when traveling with kids. There was barely any room to sit and very busy. One morning I ended up finding a table and the next morning I took our food out to the pool and sat out there with the kids which was very peaceful. The pool area is small, but enough to keep the kids busy for a couple of hours. It was a nice temperature, not too cold. They also loved going between the pool and jacuzzi. The room slept 6 of us, but was not spacious. It was nice to have the 2 queens in separate bedrooms and a living area, so if someone wanted to rest, they could close the door and others could watch TV in another room. There were 3 TVs. The beds were OK. The bathroom was small considering the room slept 6 people (not 6 adults, but doable with a mixture of adults and kids). The kitchen area was more than adequate to bring some food with you, prepare it and not eat out every meal. The decor is updated, but some areas of the room felt worn. The room was clean and we had excellent service at the front desk.Hello Snulie,Thank you for taking the time to write such a wonderful review about your recent stay at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Marriott.

Upon arrival we were greeted at the check in desk. He was very friendly and didn't waste anytime getting us on our way. We stayed on the 7th floor. The room was more like a suite. It had a king size bed and a sitting area that converted to a bed as well. The window overlooked the harbor in the distance and had a ceiling to floor window. Very modern room and hotel. Our room had a door, that conjoined to the neighboring room...this was the only flaw. I'm unsure if it was because of the conjoining door or thin walls, but we could hear everything they said and was a bit uneasy knowing they could hear us too. The hotel offers a continental breakfast. It was mediocre, like they all are. The setup was very nice and very clean. We didn't park at the hotel, 35 a night, instead we parked at the rear of the hotel. It was 3 a night in the public parking garage. This hotel is walking distance to Fells Point, Harbor East, Little Italy, and Inner Harbor. It is also under a 10 cab ride to Power Plant.	4.0
We loved the Hyatt Place Baltimore! Harbor East is a fantastic neighborhood, full of shopping and great restaurants. It is convenient walk to the bay and to Fell's Point. The rooms are very nice and the staff were very courteous. Thank you for a great long weekend!	5.0
The hotel was very clean and the staff was great! My friends and I booked this hotel for my birthday trip and we would definitely stay again. It's near the heart of the city, The French Quarters, and neatly hidden at the same time.Thank you for sharing and Happy Birthday! No better place to spend it then the Big Easy and we appreciate you allowing us to be part of it. Thank you again! Wayne General Manager	5.0
The exterior does not look super attractivebut very nice on the inside. The room was comfortable and had updated appliances. Loved that it is a pet friendly hotel that did not charge additional fees. Would highly recommend to others.	4.0
Great location on the beach, but rooms are really tiny, especially the bathroom. The free wireless internet is useless, as in our three day stay, the signal was too week to access, not even once - despite our room's nearness to the management office. No excuse for that.	3.0
Boyfriend wanted to treat to casino stay for Valentine's Day weekend but were booked and we got referred here. Never stayed at one of these and very glad we did.

"The hotel is in a good convenient area. It was clean. I made a reservation for 2 nights and they neglected to tell me that the check out time was 11am. I decided to check out before the next day after 11 and the lady at the front desk was very rude and said that ""SHE TOLD ME"" the check out time. I explained to her that she did not tell me the check out time and she would not refund my bill for the 2nd day."	3.0

Bad: We could easily hear steps from the room above us, we were on the second floor, so I had to call like twice at the front desk to complain about the noises on the room above. Good: Close to the theme parks, free parking lot, good breakfast.	4.0
Basic and a little under the standard i expect from a Best Western. Having the basin in the room as opposed to within the bathroom was not a feature that we enjoyed and the bathroom could have been cleaner	3.0
We really enjoyed our overnight visit at the Hilton Garden. The staff was very attentive and my daughter and I felt like we were home. My only disappointment was that we had to pay for breakfast. It wasn't that great, and I felt that it should have been included.	5.0
Looking out over the ocean from your balcony window trumps (almost) any negatives. The rooms are showing their age but are maintained as well as can be expected.

I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Nashua while visiting family in the area this past week-end I had a wonderful stay from beginning to the end.

Stopped here for an overnight traveling through Atlanta. The desk clerks at night were excellent. I had a problem turning my TV on - the lady at the desk came to my room to set it up. Sign in the lobby indicates they are going to start renovations soon-which are much needed - hotel was dated.	4.0

We enjoyed our stay at this establishment. The king size room was very comfortable, the bedding and mattress type in particular. One aspect of the room that I thoroughly appreciated was the ability to control the climate. In many hotels the thermostats are locked out at a certain temperature depending upon the time of the year. At this hotel you could control the cool air or heat at your discretion (major kudos...). Unfortunately a complaint was lodged with housekeeping because a specific request was made to have the sheets changed (on second day of 3 night stay), and although the request was eagerly granted, the bed linen was not changed. Upon a late return to the hotel we made another request to have the bed linen changed. The service desk accommodated us as best as they could (at 1130p) but our sheets did not get changed until 1245a when the overnight attendant came on duty. This all could have been avoided had the housekeeping receptionist paid actual attention to my request instead of merely giving me lip service. The hotel manager took excellent steps in addressing my concerns. I would definitely stay at this hotel upon future travel. Thank You!	4.0
I really enjoyed the friendly staff and the room were very stylish and my wife feel in love with the bathroom we had the 2 bedroom suite and it was fantastic . We really look forward to spending a nice romantic stay in the next couple of weeks	5.0
Stay is pleasant however, very expensive and staff no more helpful than in other hotels.

We stayed at the Holiday Inn on a weekend shopping trip to NYC. Our flight arrived at 8am and was traveling with my 3 month old baby. They let us check in early which was nice. It was very easy to go to NYC #320 bus just outside the hotel with a 20 min bus ride to Port Authority. Wifi could not access from our room had to go to lobby to get internet. Other then that it was good. Lots of dining options just outside the hotel. Walmart 5 min away. Would stay there again.	4.0
We stayed in Room 1 of the carriage house which was cozy, quaint, and comfortable. Sitting on the porch offered a lovely view.

The first room we got was soaking wet. we called the front desk. The front desk clerk got us another room. We didn't care for the noise from the road near by. If you stay there don't stay in room 225. I wanted to stay down stairs they didn't have any rooms.	3.0

Rats running around the parking lot. My husband and I saw FIVE rats running around the parking lot and one jumped out a trash can. I don't do rats I am always been afriad of rats and I wasnt expacting that. I didn't feel comfortable staying there. Management was'nt helpful at all. I was there for my son's graduation from the Navy he had completed boot camp. So this was an important visit. We had to find another hotel at night and I had to pay more money.No one was helpful to us at all.	1.0
Our stay was wonderful.The room was clean,we had plenty of towels.The staff was very friendly. I would recommend this hotel .	5.0
Everything was great. The workers at the front desk are all nice and very helpful. All the rooms are suites and they are all very clean and spacious. The best thing about it is the proximity to Angel Stadium. We went to go watch the Giants play the Angels for two days and the hotel is literally across the street from the stadium. They even let you choose what you want from their continental breakfast when you check in and have it ready for you to pick up in the morning in the lobby. There are also places to eat very close by and although we didn't get in (not enough time) the pool it looked clean and like a nice place to relax. I will definitely stay here again whenever I am in Anaheim, great hotel for a great price.	5.0

I was VERY nervous about choosing this hotel because of the negative reviews. But we were pleasantly surprised! A group of friends and I (girls, early 20s) stayed here on Saturday 12/28 and our total room cost was 115. We chose Rodeway because it was only a mile away from Bader Field where Life in Color was. The rooms were very clean! Outdated, but clean. Beds were actually pretty comfortable! Didn't use the TV. The bathrooms were also very clean. The shower's water pressure wasn't the best, but we dealt with it. Check in and check out went very quickly and smoothly. Not the friendliest people, but they got the job done. We found a place to park right outside of our room which was great. Parking is 10 which is annoying but you have to pay to park ANYWHERE in Atlantic City so I didn't mind. Anything beats paying 700 a night at Revel (that was their rate on the same night!!!). We were barely in our room all night, so this hotel is perfect for a group of friends who are just looking for a place to shower, pregame, and sleep. I wouldn't recommend this place to a couple only because it's not really romantic or anything. It's very basic, which is what we were looking for. There is a free breakfast but of course we didn't wake up early enough (ends at 10), however there was still fresh, hot coffee at 12pm when we checked out which was nice. This place is definitely NOT a 5-star hotel, but it's also not bad either. And no, we didn't see any hookers!	4.0
I like this place, even though it is a 30-minute commute to my work location, but the shuttle to Metro is convenient. This time one of the elevators was out of service with a note that it would be fixed the Monday of my arrival, but it was still out of commission when I left. The only drawback is the breakfast. One day, they added some sausage patties to the steamer table and it was actually cold--not even room temperature. It should have been heated first, because it appeared to be leftover from another day (and not just 1 day ago because the day before they had links, not patties). The last day, there wasn't even really meat. They had eggs, potatoes and grits along with corned beef hash, which is more of a potato entree--not a meat entree. For someone like myself, who doesn't eat potatoes, there was essentially no meat. Hopefully in the future, there will be plain meat--either bacon or sausage. I would not hesitate to come back here in the future.	4.0
Too much construction all around Jan. 2016--the street, two hotel buildings behind and adjacent made it very noisy!! Check this before booking...Rooms large, good cleaning service, helpful staff at front desk. Street parking is difficult to find...beware of towing.	3.0
It's hard to find an affordable nice place to stay in this area. The price was great and so was our room. The only thing I'd change would be trays to take breakfast to your room because there was no where to sit. That's minor though.	5.0

Ever time we travel to D.C., one of our kids' favorite destinations, we struggle to find the right place in the right area. We either find a nice place that is almost a mile from the Metro stop or we find a crappy place within steps of a stop. The Ritz was on-point. From the ambience, to the staff, the quality of food, cleanliness of the rooms, down to the way they treated our children we loved it! The cherry on the ice cream is the Ritz is litterally 100 ft from the Metro. We will never search for a hotel again!	5.0
I have a different opinion of Best Westerns after staying at this hotel. Very, very nice accommodations for the price. I would definitely go back again!We are glad we surprised you!

The hotel is an economy hotel but it was one of the best my spouse and I stayed in. Everyone was very friendly. Upon arrival to my room, the receptionist called and make sure everything was OK. I do not even get this kind of service at high end hotels. So Kudos to the level of service. The hotel was clean and comfortable. The location is roughly 30-45 min drive to DC depending on traffic. The swimming pool was only 6pm-10pm on weekdays and only a few hours on weekends. So If you plan to use the pool you really have to plan for it. Overall my experience for this hotel was very nice.	5.0

I stayed with my sister in this hotel...Basically, as it was New Years, various other hotels closer to the the Strip were booked. The SunCoast staff were very helpful friendly, even when our flight was delayed and we had to reschedule our shuttle pick-up from the airport---use this! The SunCoast is very far from the airport and it is free so you will save yourself money.The rooms and bathrooms were very clean and spacious. The buffet downstairs was decent. The only downside is, again, its distance from the Strip. The shuttle times are not very convenient, especially if you want to spend a night on the town. The cab fare from the Strip to our hotel costs us around 30. So, keep that in mind.Hope this helps!	4.0
Had a really nice stay at hotel renew. Was close to the beach near to where they have a concrete break to stop the waves crashing, so would be good for young families. The bed was really comfy. Only a couple of negatives, the room we were in had a window in the bathroom, and a frosted glass door to the bathroom. This meant light streamed in through the window and door in the morning. Also there wasn't much for breakfast if you are trying to avoid sugar and there wasn't a lot of space.Aloha!!!Mahalo nui loa (thank you very much) for choosing to stay with us and for providing valuable feedback of your experience.

Stayed overnight on 4/23/16 with my sister at the hotel and was very pleasantly surprised! The hotel's location was great and the interiors were very stylish. My sister and I stayed in a room with a wonderful view of Trump Tower, Marina City, the Chicago's river and bridges. The room itself, although small, was clean and nicely decorated. Our room had twin beds that were firm but comfortable to sleep on. The hotel was perfect for our needs! We wanted a place to stay near the loop where we could make the most of our weekend downtown. Also, the staff was friendly and the customer service manager that assisted us, Pedro, was very helpful. We plan on coming again in the fall for another weekend downtown and will be staying there again.Dear 216jvs,Thank you for your detailed review of the River Hotel. I am so glad you found the room and staff services to your liking and you were able to enjoy your weekend from our ideal location in the heart of the city.

We spent four days at this hotel and it was a good experience. We wanted to visit Napa Valley but many on the inns and hotels are very expensive. We certainly were not planning to spend much time at the hotel and just wanted something comfortable and convenient. It is located a 5 minute drive from downtown Napa and 10 minutes away from the Wine Train Station. There are many things nearby if you need stuff. There is a Dennys next to the hotel and a Target, Applebees, IHOP and many more fast food restaurants just across the road. Since we were traveling with kids it was good to have different options. The hotel is very basic but well-kept. The rooms are big and comfortable and so is the bathroom. There is a tiny pool and hot tub outside. The kids liked that. We enjoyed our experience there.We are very happy that you, our world travlers from China, enjoyed your stay with us. If you ever get back to Napa we look foward to being your home away from home again.	5.0
Ten minutes from Dares beach and 20 minutes from Chesapeake beach. The proximity to everything is second to none. The staff are amazing and they're very accommodating.

This is a nice property, just by the lake union. The folks at the front desk were warm, friendly and helpful. I really liked this gentleman who would even strain his neck if there are lots of people at the reception and and peek out to say welcome back! when I return from office! Ha!There are a lots of eateries by the lake, so that's a win too.Some improvement opportunities - this is the only hotel where I found the housekeeping would just keep the bed and bath but wouldn't clear out used glasses, plates, soda cans etc. Those stuff were there on the table even after housekeeping was done.It would be great to have some variety in their room service. Especially if it rains, people opt to stay in have some food and I found the bistro options very limited.Also, the bistro staff were either very nice or made a bad impression - for instance, this one lady with a curly bobbed hair appeared very rude and made me feel like I am serving her when she came to deliver my food and in another instance, this one man appeared oh so friendly, almost too friendly and the moment I signed the receipt he was looking for the tip amount - making the whole thing feel like a forced show to get tip rather than genuine hospitality.But yea, the property is great and everything is at walkable or short driving distance. Overall 4 star experience.	4.0

Bad: At the arrival, we paid the parking fee in cash (43) and the rest of the amount for two nights stay with a credit card. Checking the transactions during the last couple of days we realized that the parking fee has been charged on the credit card TOO. We asked for an explanation and have not received any answer at all. It's simply unacceptable. The room furniture is old, need a renovation. The space around all windows - both in the room and the shower - and the windows themselves were very dirty. Basically no choice for breakfast - consisted of two types of cereal, boiled eggs, white and whole grain bread. Good: Coffee machine available at all the time free.	2.0
Our guests had a fabulous weekend. Rooms were beautiful. Staff were amazing and so accommodating. Comfortable lobby with pool table and games was a great meeting space. We had a light breakfast for our guests the morning after the wedding in the lobby and it worked out great. Would highly recommend Aloft Downtown as the hotel for your wedding guests!Hi Jeanne, Thanks for the FIVE BUBBLES!! It was a thrill to serve the entire wedding party. It was the first time we used W XYZ for a wedding brunch and we're delighted you enjoyed the space. Sorry about the rain, it would have been really cool for your family and friends to enjoy the Backyard. Hope the bride and groom enjoy the honeymoon! We'd love to have all of you back for the anniversaries! Evan	5.0
Friendly staff, HUGE breakfast, clean rooms, quiet at night, close to the interstate, and shops not too far away for anything else you need. I left behind some keys and the front desk clerk called me 30 minutes after I left, fortunately I hadn't gotten too far down the road so I could come back to get them!	4.0
We used the app to check-in and this made for a seamless and very quick check-in by super friendly staff. We stayed here following arrival by the Clipper which was a 65 (including tip) cab ride as we had an early morning flight the next day. Shuttle to the airport next day was efficient and driver very pleasant. Loved the... More	4.0
Modern looking hotel. Room lay out worked for smaller space. I thought is was weird that the door to the room opened directly into the bathroom. Didn't like that there was no self park, but I believe all hotels in downtown New Orleans have that.You'd be correct, most downtown NOLA properties are valet only. We understand Aloft isn't for everyone but truly appreciate you giving us a try. Thanks for staying! Yours in hospitality, Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations	4.0
Made reservation for room with roll-in shower, with a bench/chair to use - there was no bench/chair available.

This is probably the cheapest dim sum restaurant in SGV. When I say cheapest, not just the price but the portion of the dishes. You really get your moneys worth.

PROS: Amazing views from lake view rooms worth extra 10! Great location close to Space Needle and great restaurants in Lower Queen Anne. We walked to Space Needle and City Center in 15 minutes, it's about 1.1 miles. If you include parking, it is faster to walk. The newly completed MOHI is right across the street, which is well worth the price of admission - we spent half a day there. Great, friendly customer service from front desk staff (Marriott 800-number, not so much.) Now that construction is complete on Mercer access to downtown and the freeway is a piece of cake. Free evening (after 9am-4pm) and weekend parking right across the street (vs 27/night garage parking). CONS: Marriott reservations gave me a hard time trying to get a cheaper rate that came available. Water in room is 3.00. Candy bar in market is 3.50 and they have removed the vending machines. Two cans of beer in market were 14 (the price of 12 a the store). Bistro menu is pretty short. We were not sure if there was any breakfast room service because there was only a dinner menu in our room. Power button on TV remote did not work, but channel changer and volume did.WEIRD: I have never seen a green flushing toilet that used so much water!!! The flushes were torrential. More than my standard toilet at home by double.Thank you so much for taking the time to share your recent experience at our hotel on Trip Advisor! I am happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us, particularly the view from your room! We love the changes that have been taking place in the South Lake Union neighborhood, particularly now that the roadwork is complete. I did want to share that while we do offer room-delivery for dinner, our breakfast is only available in the Bistro. However we are happy to package anything on the menu to-go if needed!We hope you will choose our hotel again next time your travels bring you to Seattle.Sincerely,Rachel PackardFront Office Supervisor	4.0
This was the nicest SpringHill Suites I've stayed at. Beautiful lobby and room, the staff were all very friendly and helpful, and the price was awesome for summertime. The airport shuttle was quick and efficient. The hotel was very clean. I'd definitely recommend you staying here.	5.0
Bad: Room and bed were tiny - not even a queen bed. Bed took up most of the room. Breakfast was coffee and a bunch of cold bagels. Bathroom was also tiny. Not worth the exhorbitant price at all. Good: Location was good.	3.0

Stayed here for a week and had a fantastic experience. After reading other great reviews, decided that combined with price, this sounded like a great place to stay. Was not disappointed. Location was great -- less than 1 block to Waikiki Beach. Only 1 block other direction to bus stops, Kuhio Ave. Was able to walk from hotel to any Waikiki attraction in very short distance. I was glad I upgraded to the ocean view room because the view was great. Leonor was a wonderful host, providing us with bamboo mats, rafts, and beach towels free of charge, and boxes of candy on departure. This hotel will very shortly have a new name, though, as it is being remodeled. The rooms now are old, but clean. The new rooms that Leonor showed us are unbelievable with modern amenities. The first of the new rooms are set to open in a few wks. Can't imagine what this will do to the price but with the location and helpful staff, it just might be worth it.Would recommend staying here to anyone looking for a hotel low on price and great on hospitality!	5.0

We arrived early we were told we could check in at 11:30. We went did some running around came back. We were then told we couldnt check in until 1:30. Once we finally checked in we were told we had to put down a 100 deposit. That was not said when we booked the room. We were given a room with no view (houses) when we specifically asked for one with a city view so we had to go back downstairs get a new room. There was no refridgerator, no coffee pot, no microwave. We wont be back there. We could have stayed somewhere else that was on the strip for the same price and gotten more ammenities.	2.0
I recently stayed at this hotel while attending a conference at the Washington Convention Center. This hotel is about a mile from the convention center but the hotel has a shuttle for free. My room was very clean and welcoming. My only minor issue with the hotel is the HVAC system in the room does not allow for fan on at all time. I prefer this while sleeping.Dear Hunterhersh: Thank you for completing a TripAdvisor regarding your recent stay at the Hyatt House Seattle. Please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be. I greatly appreciate your kind words and they will be celebrated with the entire team. I am glad to hear that you enjoyed the location and our free shuttle. I will investigate the HVAC system, i am sorry that this was was an inconvenience for you! If I can be of any assistance to you, please contact me directly. We look forward to being of service to you in the near future. We appreciate your business! Sincerely, Jonathan	5.0
Bad: The hotel is next to train tracks so there is some noise from that pretty often but it's really not so bad and you kind of have to expect some noise when you're staying at a hotel that's literally in the middle of the city. Good: Very tech friendly as the hotel has its own smartphone app which allows you to order room service and control the thermostat among other things. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The room is designed very well. Also the price of the mini bar items are actually reasonable.	5.0

Great room and nice to have complimentary breakfast and coffee/tea most of the day. Facilities were clean and well maintained.

I called the Ramada the morning I was checking in to verify the check in time as well as verify that the room type I requested would be available, I was assured it would be. When I arrived a few hours later, the room type was unavailable. They also had a sign posted indicating the water would be off until 3:30pm. I should have received some sort of notification or gotten some sort of compensation for this considering the water was not back on until 5:45 or so. When I turned the faucet on the water was brown and disgusting - I certainly was not going to get ice or regular water from this establishment.Wi-Fi was incredibly spotty. No password, less than ZERO security. Disappointed.	2.0

My girlfriends and I booked the sheraton for our weekend trip to Miami.. The hotel did not get our booking correct, we were not give a balcony room although we had booked one. They would not accommodate our requests to move to a balcony room and stated the entire hotel was sold out, so we sucked it up and went to the standard double room. Upon our arrival we were hit in the face with a SWELTERING, tiny room. The room temperature was above 90. We called the front desk and explained the problem only to be dismissed very quickly by rude staff again stating the hotel was sold out. They sent up the maintenance man who said he fixed it after trying for less than 10 mins. Three hours later room was still insanely hot, so we demanded a manager come up to check it out. Finally, two managers came and confirmed that the room was indeed unbearable and we weren't just complaining for no reason. Another 6 hours later, at around midnight, we were given a new room an upgrade to a suite - which was honestly a standard size room (whereas the first room which was supposed to be standard) was a sardine can size. The staff left our luggage in the lobby for hours before bringing it to our room at midnight and said they didn't know who it belonged to so they couldn't move it to a safe place. The staff was rude, the hotel is rundown, the rooms are tiny, the bars are gross, the pool water was disgusting. This hotel was just not good. I'd spend a little bit more of the money and stay elsewhere.	1.0

I was charged 244 for a one night stay in a very average room, I expected far better for the price sadly this is a similar standard of a holiday inn or days inn who are far cheaper. Staff were friendly enough, reception appeared to be under construction, I shall not be using this Marriott againThank you for your recent comments regarding the hotel. I understand the importance of receiving a value of staying in a downtown hotel, and Im sorry you didnt feel you received that value while staying in the hotel. At this time, the hotel is undergoing a major re-imaging of the lobby space and exterior with additional plans to begin the rooms and fitness area. Once this is completed, I hope you will give us another opportunity so you may see the value of the location and to gain your loyalty. Thank you again for your feedback.	1.0

The hotel location was excellent. The attached restaurants are high end and perfect for celebrating a special occasion. The Saturday afternoon chocolate and champagne tasting was a real treat.

We were disappointed in the room - however, I will say that if you're looking for a small place with a great view and a really nice park directly across the street, this place is perfect. Also, the rooftop bar was great - although a bit pricey.

My boyfriend and I had a most excellent stay here! We checked in on this past Sunday and stayed until this Tuesday. From our arrival we were greeted by Benny, the Bell Captain who along with the rest of his Bell staff took care of us from go. We were allowed to check in early to a Junior Suite 102 which had a beautiful view of the Ocean located at the end of the street. Our suite was located out in a building separate from the main hotel and off the pool area. Just around the corner from the front desk. Our suite was large had a separate sitting area with a flat screen TV and a small fridge under the counter which had plenty of cabinet space. 2 sinks one in the bathroom and one in the counter where the fridge was. Luxurious Bathrobes that I ABSOLUTELY wanted (will put on my birthday list :) Bellman Dan scooted us over to a local restaurant in the hotel golf cart... they will offer to take you just about anywhere and will also return to pick you up.rnrnService at the Front Desk was exceptional, friendly, courteous and consistently above and beyond helpful! I commend who ever does the hiring here because they have done a Fantastic job of hiring people that either love their job and sincerely want you to enjoy your stay or they do a great job in faking it LOLrnrnHotel is located within walking distance of all the quaint shops, it has it's own restaurant but we were not impressed with the menu... we did however take advantage of the happy hour deal the appetizers were tasty and 1/2 off as was their signature cocktail Orange Crush. The day before the boyfriend ordered a Cloud 9 that was the BOMB! and I got my favorite Lemon Drop both were flavorful but I must say this was the only place I was not impressed with the Bar Service it took a while for our appetizers to arrive and they were not as attentive as the rest of the hotel staff had been /rnrnAll and all a very nice place to drop in during the week we get the impression that weekends here (like most places) are a zoo. Parking on the street down the hill is free so don't spend the 22.00 on valet just find a spot on the street.rnrnRespectfully Reviewedrn	5.0
Bad: No description of the complimentary shuttle service to universal. One shuttle per day leaves at 735 am. Would not have booked here had that been clear.

The hotel is not outside the gates of anything as the description stated also. Good: Breakfast was excellent	4.0
Your staff is extremely friendly, sincere and professional. A sense of caring, and security was clearly evident - with a driver to ensure a positive experience was provided. Room was nicely furnished with all the amenities. Breakfast and manager's special was the right touch with the right level of support too. Entire hotel is very warm to include common areas as well. Exercise room has everything to get in a workout and the pool and hot tub is a great treat too. The papers, especially the WSJ is a great complimentary item.

I stayed for 2 nights here where the rooms and service met up with other Marriott properties I have stayed in the past. Like the other reviews here, the only issue here was hearing the train whistle. As I grew up close to a train crossing, hearing it didn't bother me but I could see how someone not used to it could be really shaken by the experience.Other than that, they offer a value-filled room with kitchenette, a well-equipped one at that. Similar to Residence Inn properties, there's a fridge, dishwasher, sink, and stove along with some basic cookware and utensils. This property even had a food disposal unit.As much as there was a bed, living area, bathroom, kitchenette, and work desk, there really wasn't much place to sit down and eat for more than one person. I suppose a group of people could eat in the living area but I wouldn't find it all that comfortable.The services available in the lobby were fantastic, there a computer with free internet AND free printing (although there's a 30-minute time limit to be fair to other guests). There's also complimentary coffee available all day and even a map of the general area where the attractions, shopping, and restaurants are listed.	4.0

So this hotel is pretty nice to look at, and the staff was very friendly, however, we entered the room (very small) and continued to look at the room. We lifted up the sheets and it was clean and mattress was clean, however in the box spring of the bed, there was a swarm of bed bugs that once we flashed the light on them they all dove into the box spring. We continued and the front desk and they upgraded our room, however due to our disgust we arranged a booking at the Hyatt Regency down the road which was beyond clean. Thank you Front desk for your efforts to accommodate, but we could not deal with the bed bugs in your hotel.Guest feedback is important to us and we take any comment regarding bedbugs seriously. We have a proactive pest elimination policy that includes regularly scheduled inspections by a professional pest control company. Additionally we have thoroughly trained all of our housekeeping associates to inspect our guest rooms for any signs of pest activity. If necessary, our pest control company conducts bed bug elimination procedures using the latest in pesticide technology.I encourage anyone with questions or comments regarding our pest control policy to contact me directly at 312.777.0805 .

This hotel was originally a livery back in the 1860s and it has all the character and charm a boutique hotel should have. A manager there told us the support beams and posts were from the original building- very cool. The rooms were large and designed with an antique flair and each room was attributed to a Florida governor so... More	5.0
Nice place with a great staff. This place is clean and well maintained. Being Massachusetts there are no alcoholic beverages during the managers reception. The breakfast was great too. The bar remains open until midnight and is a great place to unwind after visiting the city.	5.0
Great property with friendly and helpful staff. Location is equally convenient to Tacoma and SEATAC. Lots of conveniences and shopping within close proximity. Property is clean well maintained. Prefer this over other lodging in the area.	5.0
Good new option for hotels in Napa. Centrally located near new retail center south of downtown Napa. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Very typical Hampton Inn room setup. Nothing special, but reasonable alternative to other hotels in the area. Dear P5041IYwilliamk,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We appreciate your feedback. There are several options for hotels in Napa and we love to provide our guest with a Hampton value of complementary internet, complementary parking, complementary breakfast, our added features of pool and spa as well as a nice patio area with a fireplace and 2 fire pits which not all Hampton's have. We thank you again for your feedback and hope to see you again on your next trip to Napa Valley. Best Regards, Serina Najar.	4.0
This hotel is a great place for a relaxing family getaway. Just steps away from the soft sand beach. The pool is great. The staff are professional and friendly. I am particular about cleanliness and service but found this hotel satisfying in all areas.	5.0
This Hampton Inn is new and well-appointed, and seems to be a popular choice for people touring wineries, as our group was. There was a little street noise in my room, but tolerable.The staff were uniformly pleasant and helpful, from front desk to housekeeping.Breakfast is of the standard you would expect for this type of hotel, with some reasonable choices and slight changes from day to day.It is not located in the center of Napa, so to go to most restaurants, you need a car.	5.0
Went to Cincinnati for a weekend as we often do during the summer. Our favorite hotels were booked or had very high rates, so we decided to try the Mellennium, which is very nearby. The hotel looks very nice from the outside. We upgraded to deluxe rooms in order to get a king sized bed. The rooms were adequate. My... More	3.0
Our room was fairly modern, good cable tv, and clean, We didn't have parking problems as some have, but it is so true that the entrance is near-impossible to find the first time. There's a large neon sign that points toward it, but the actual entrance (a few hundred yards away) is not lit. By all means pay the extra... More	4.0
The hotel was centrally located to where I needed to be. It is about 10-15 minutes from the Scranton Wilkes-Barre airport. The hotel entrance is a bit hidden from the main road. You must make a sharp turn then go up an incline before you see the main building and parking lot. Leaving, use caution as you must turn onto... More	5.0
Hotel is in a great location for Napa and Sonoma wine tasting. Good breakfast and wine tasting from 5 to 6 pm in the lobby. Clean hotel with nice patio. Decent workout room and friendly staff make for a pleasant stay.	5.0
The service was friendly, helpful and outgoing. The room was clean and beds comfy. Walls a little on the thin side and no mini fridge was our only complaint along with an aggressive shower head. Yes I would return to this hotel. The food was good and the people who worked their were outstanding.	5.0
Bad: sheets seemed unwashed and old item from previous occupant was still in closet.	3.0
I booked 28 rooms at the Palo Duro Canyon Inn and Suites. I booked with the Manager and he was very helpful. The hotel is pretty from the outside and the inside is very nice. It was a good choice.

My family I stayed the Neptune hotel. The Neptune hotel was a nice place to stay. It was a spacious room for all of us. And most importantly the hotel is right off the beach! You get to wake up to the ocean :) Yolanda helped us check in, she was very nice and helpful. I'd stay there... More	3.0
We loved the hotel and the staff. The concierges were especially helpful. It is in the best location for sightseeing and restaurants. One criticism - when I booked with your service, you told me a carriage ride and walking tour were included. The hotel staff said they never have included those extras. Hotels.com needs to straighten that out.	5.0
Very nice spot to take a few days and enjoy the local color and Rocky Mountain National Park. The staff were friendly, helpful, accommodative and very nice. The room itself was large with a deck that faced the river and featured large friendly elk who visit during morning coffee and evening cocktails. More importantly the room was very clean. I'll...

What one would expect for an RC property. The restaurant was excellent and the room was spacious and comfortable. It is near many restaurants and the Metro station is right in front for an affordable commute into D.C. All things considered, a great pick for you stay in the D.C. area.	5.0
I have stayed in this area a few times and think it is among the best if you are approaching D.C. from the south by car. There is a nice shuttle to the nearby Metro and mall area so you can stay parked for your stay. If you have to drive, it is closer to D.C. and Arlington then it looks on the map. The rooms are a bit small but reasonably comfortable. Breakfast is a notch above the usual fare. Best of all, price is affordable for families or for the business traveler.	4.0
Trip to Barnes Hospital required a few day stay at Hampton. Impressed with staff and quality of service/product delivered. Everyone was helpful from the front desk, room service and all staff. Nice place next door to eat also. Thank you, well done!	5.0

We stayed in a room for 2 nights over Labor Day weekend. The place has a lot of character and it was a perfect place to spend time with my family.

It took at least 30 minutes to get checked in. then my key cards would not work. we went to a concert and showed back up at the hotel around midnight and the whole building smelled like poop. Just checked my bank account and they charged me twice for the room. not pleased at all	1.0
So this isn't the best motel out there but the price is right and if you are just looking for a place to crash for a night it will do. The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. You can bring your pets in the room with you. It's close to the freeway and Marie Callendars (which has wonderful breakfasts). Try it out you won't be disappointed.	3.0
a very nice experience for people taking the auto train for the first time as we did....cant' go wrong with this hotel.....everyone was very nice ....would go back if the situation was the same	4.0
It may look a bit dated as seen from the road and most of the the rooms we have stayed in are on the small side, but the utilization of space and attention to detail is amazing. Breakfast is the basic typical fare, very relaxed in the bright cheerful lobby area.	5.0
The room was very clean and bathroom was spacious and luxurious. We are very satisfied staying here.	5.0
Room was adequate, but the hotel needs maintenance bad. Porch deck was dirty, the outdoor carpeting was awful...don't walk without shoes!

Something is seriously wrong with the hotel in this casino! Customer service in the casino is outstanding in the hotel not so much. Left our room at 8am to go to the Grand Canyon for the day. Upon returning at 9pm that night found our hotel room door open with the lock holding the door open! Checked the room and it appeared everything was still intact. Talk to the night supervisor at the front desk about it. She told us there was nothing she could do about it and she would call security. Security met us at our room. Talked to us, checked the room and they decided it was no big deal as nothing was missing! So I guess they think it's ok for your room to be open when you are not there! And for at least 8 hrs too. They treated us like we were scamming them or something. Talked to casino night supervisor about it and finally got someone who actually cared. But could give us no answers until she talked to the casino manager.Casino manager finally called next day and said she would comp our room for one night. Well to make this long story short, night was not comped ended up paying for our full 4 nights! I asked to talk to the casino manger again but was told they would not be in until noon. I will never stay in this hotel again nor will I gamble here either. If you stay here lock all your valuables up in the safe. And be prepared for terrible customer service if anything does go wrong. Casino manager did call back later in the day and did comp two nights but I find the actions of the front desk supervisor as well as the security people unacceptable! Also every one acted like it was not a big deal. Maybe they should have someone leave their front doors open all day and see how they feel about that!Thank you for taking the time to post your comments. We apologize for any inconveniences you experienced during your stay. Please be assured that finding your room open is of great concern, and we have advised all appropriate departments of your specific situation. At no time did we think you were scamming or something of that nature. While we can understand your frustrations, please understand there are policies and procedures to be followed in a situation like this. We hope you enjoyed the rest of your trip, the Grand Canyon must have been amazing to see in person!	1.0
I travel at least once per year and as far as all the hotels I've been to, this has been the best by far. The food, service and room was probably the best that I've experienced.

The stay was highly satisfactory. We were very impressed with Dan, who was managing the desk. There seemed to be some confusion about the category of room (we were allotted a room meant for handicapped person) but Dan straightened it out within a minute. He was also helpful with neighborhood information. Will stay there if we visit Newport again.	5.0
We were here in Los Angels (Hawthrone) because we have to attend my father in law's funeral. My family all came (3 adult with my granddaughter total of 4 of us). I booked this hotel a week ago and didn't know our daughter or granddaughter will come until last minutes. We were very please and happy that I booked this... More	5.0
I wanted quiet with no amenities. I thoroughly enjoyed and used the wave sound machine in the room. I enjoyed the crabby hour one of the two nights I stayed. Staff and shuttle service were extrememly helpful and timely. I could walk all over the Inner Harbor and keep my car parked in an adjacent lot. Due to bad weather, I was able to just walk to the restaurant attached and have an excellent meal.	4.0
The hotel clerk checked someone else into our room and we were awoken in terror at 1 am by someone attemping to enter our room (their key opened the door but we had the slide lock closed). Never had a problem with Microtel in the past, but this was so far beyond unacceptable that we'll never stay at one again.	1.0
I had an event to attend in Palm Beach and did not want to have to drive home late that evening. It was the perfect opportunity to stay at The Colony.

Our hotel room was spotless. The staff were so helpful and caring. They helped us out with our car. It's rare to find people who will help a stranger.

The front staff was friendly and helpful. She was able to accommodate me in a first floor room knowing I had twins and the hotel does not have an elevator. The room looks great. My only problem was that a roach crawled on my phone. After that I questioned the cleanliness of the room.	3.0
When we arrived, we thought that the pool would suffice as our main form of entertainment, but since the pool was packed beyond belief, we were forced to find other forms of entertainment.

The nicest attitude from the Manager to front desk and room assistance. The shuttle driver was pleasant and very helpful. Not only did he suggest places to eat, and take us to the place of our choice, it was the best Italian restaurant ever. He also made sure we saw the Memorial to the bombing victims both in daylight and after dark. Not to be missed!! Room was clean, fresh, completely stocked with amenities, and the bed was comfortable. I look forward to finding a reason to go back to Oklahoma City and the Knights Inn at Bricktown Hotel.	5.0

Didn't do a review for our March/April visit but our stay for July/August was just as good and as always its like coming home to Family, our Maid Ada is an absolute star and looked after us to perfection, all the girls in the coffee shop are great and even have our order prepared if they seen us walking up for our morning coffee, special mention for Whitney who was good enough to take us shopping one day, Suncoast you have lots of real stars working here that make our trips great and even harder to leave on our long journey home,see you all in March 2018.	5.0

My family and I decided to stay overnight before our departure to Jamaica. We live about 50 miles from the airport so we could have driven to the airport. We decided to take off the stress of getting our teens up early and rushing through morning traffic. The rooms were clean and spacious and cocktail hour was enjoyable. The morning of our departure we had a quick breakfast in the lobby and a shuttle service was arranged to take us to the airport. We made the right decision to stay at the Drury Inn.	5.0
We had a great experience on this hotel, good premises, really clean but what really impressed me the most was the Staff: we were greeted by Brianda and Carlos, and they were absolutely amazing, they were .extra helpful to us.

I was looking for a (relatively) inexpensive place to stay for a week long course. The hotel was conveniently located for me. It has excellent beach access. Rooms are small with some inconveniences, but adequate. Parking spaces are way too narrow. You can park entirely within the marked lines and still have trouble getting into and out of your car. Overall it met my needs, and I would certainly consider staying there again.	4.0

We stayed at the San Ramon Marriott for 3 nights. As a frequent Marriott guest, I had access to the concierge lounge on the top floor, which featured free breakfast and snacks.

Everything about our stay from the moment we checked in was a very positive experience. Our room was clean and had everything we needed. The pool area was also nice and clean with plenty of towels and loungers available. The breakfast area was also clean and well attended to. We were also given a one hour late checkout which made my daughter extremely happy as it gave her a chance for one more swim before we left. A perfect stay while we were in the Keys!Thank you for the five star review. So glad to hear our folks at the front office were able to extend a later departure so your daughter could get that one last swim!! Thank you for sharing your experience and we look forward to welcoming you back to our little island!	5.0

Located a couple of block from Canal Street in New Orleans, this hotel provided efficient and highly satisfactory service. The front staff is very helpful. The bed and pillows were VERY comfortable, more comfortable than in any other hotel I have stayed in. Once I had an almost equally comfortable bed in a Hilton, but this was tops. I would definitely return to this hotel chain.Wow! Thankful you've taken the time to share your great feedback with us and the Trip Advisor community. We have the Westin Heavenly Bed System, they do have some items for retail purchase in case you wanted to check those out. See you next time,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager	5.0
We where a late check in and Juliana was so accommodating. I spoke to her a few hours earlier to ask if someone can set up the sofa bed on the room since we where running late and going straight to bed. She did that for us, which I really appreciate. Thanks. The breakfast was delicious and the two attendances where so sweet. I don't remember their names, but I just want to say thanks. The lady that speaks noticed my puertorrican accent and told me that she hopes that everything is good with my family back in the island. From the bottom of my heart thank you for been so sweet with me.During check out, Joy, was so understandable with me and my group. Sorry for making you separate the reservation balance in 4 credit cards.

Bad: A little sticker shock with 65/night valet parking, but I hadn't done my research for cheaper options, so not a big deal. Good: Super hip and definitely a young techy vibe, but everyone was friendly and helpful. Room was as described and very spacious for the location and price. Even though it is right at the corner of the L Tracks, sound wasn't a problem. Exactly what was needed!	5.0

"This was a great value. We upgraded to a suite when we arrived to be near the pool. The room was huge and the staff was friendly although we could've done without the 7 a.m. wake up knock on our door from housekeeping. So don't forget to use your ""do not disturb"" sign. The free continental breakfast was generous and fresh. We would stay here again."	4.0
I discovered this place after our reservations couldn't be found and were now fully booked at another beachside hotel, and to be honest I'm glad we stayed here instead!

Noisy hotel, paper thin walls and not conducive to sleep. We stayed here because it was near the hospital and we heard they offered a special rate for hospital patients. We were not offered a discount rate and got no sleep before surgery either! Hippy dog in halls at 2 am, car traffic late night and early morning, dark surroundings with little security are reasons why we will never stay here again. Also, no smoking room reeked of smoke especially when bathroom fan was turned on. Morning receptionist did nothing to resolve.	1.0

The hotel is well worth the extra money! Excellent staff, the facilities are very nice, and it's well located. 35 minutes from the beach in one direction 35 minutes from Williamsburg/Busch Gardens in the other direction.

The breakfast each morning was really quite good. A lot of food and a lot of choices - not just carbs. Also, the shuttle that takes your from the hotel to anywhere within 3 miles was extremely valuable. We got to see DC and paid much less than average per night because the shuttle allowed us to go to the Metro every day, We also used the shuttle to go to restaurants for dinner, pick up a rental car for one day, and even church on Sunday	5.0

While the hotel is quite central, the choice of restaurants very close to the hotel is not good. Good: Front desk staff were friendly and happy to give advice etc. Nice hotel with funky rooms. Room we had was a bit noisy at night - can turn the fridge off but still noise from air con or something else.	4.0
Yes, it was convenient and our expectations of a Marriott property that were well met. Our room was spacious and very adequate, and in fact exceeded our expectations. Henry Jones checked us in with cordial and competent ease. The evening was restful and uneventful, the breakfast was exceptional. It is a 4 star hotel.	5.0
Great boutique hotel in the heart of Prescott. Each room has its unique design and decor. I stay every month for work. The bed linens are amazingly soft. The room and bathroom is very clean. Staff is wonderful.	5.0
My girlfriend and I were stayed one night here and loved the location . All of the shops and restaurants are walkable from this hotel and the staff was great. Breakfast is also included which is an added bonus. Parking is the only negative , which is 20 on site and 5 two blocks away.	4.0
Great!	5.0
First on all Sam the shuttle driver was great!!!!! I can not say enough about him. To get to the hotel, you must call for the shuttle to guarantee they will arrive at their schedule times or take a taxi which should cost you 5. We were burned upon arrival with a 10 fee while he stayed on his mobile phone. Turns out the hotel is a quick 3 to 4 minute ride. The hotel is definitely too far to walk and neighborhood between metro and hotel is a bit sketchy with the apartments but the hotel is in a descant and quiet area. The check in staff did not seem too friendly nor helpful when asked about surrounding area. Once we got to know Sam, everything became better. He made sure we got got to metro station which is very convenient on time and inquired when we would return. He was there waiting!!!! Hotel is doing some remodeling but does not effect your stay. Thanks again Sam!!!!!	3.0

If you're visiting the beach stay here!! I'm a former local and know all about the excessive noise and confusion on the oceanfront. Stay at this lovely, quiet bay front hotel and drive to the craziness of the oceanfront when you want to go down there. Park in the municipal lot on Pacific and 19th street and you're in the heart of the tourist area. Take you own bikes and simply ride all over the boardwalk....then go back to a quiet comfortable relaxing hotel room.	5.0
This hotel is in a very convenient location. Only 15 minutes to Tulip Town and Roozengaarde. Everything in the Skagit Valley was easy to get to yet still not a lot of congestion in the hotel area. The included breakfast was pretty good but not great. Best of all, in my opinion, was that our room was very, very clean.... More	5.0

Although this hotel was not off the beach, it was just a small walk down from all major shopping and beach area. Hotel was recently redone and is much nicer than some of the higher priced hotels along beach front. You get to control your a/c. I wish we had stayed here for the entire stay. The neighborhood has great little pubs and small shops and restaurants that you might want to check out as well.	4.0
The Suncoast Hotel and Casino has become our home away from home. We are treated like family on our return visits. It's nice to see familiar faces the casino staff and restaurant staff. We especially enjoy the Oyster Bar Restaurant. The hotel rooms are beautiful, comfortable, clean, and roomy. The golf course and mountain views are beautiful while having breakfast. We always rent a car to visit some of our favorite places. Enterprise rent a car is right up the road they pick you up at the hotel and drop you off when you are done with the car. The distance between the strip and downtown is REALLY not a problem. The location and atmosphere is laid back away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and there is a Cheesecake Factory across the street where we always visit at least once while we are there. All in all, if you visit Las Vegas to relax and do some casual gambling, this is a gem of a place to stay. We would highly recommend the Suncoast, but rent a car if you want to check out the rest of the city......Aloha!	5.0
We only stayed one night but enjoyed our stay. The hotel is one of the cheaper options for decent accommodation in waikiki. Staff are super friendly and efficient.

We needed a room for one day after surgery and having to return to the hospital the next day so Aloft was closest! To our pleasant surprise the staff was above and beyond accommodating from Tevin in Valet department to Misia and Tatyanna front desk! Thank you so much! Linda, Hopefully the surgery was as successful as the as your visit to our hotel. We do have the BEST STAFF and are grateful for their efforts. Tatyanna, Misha and Tevin will be cheered and celebrated for your shout out. Thank you for recognizing their efforts. Heal fast, then come back and have some fun!Evan	5.0
For the price, the hotel was satisfactory. However, we had an extremely long wait at night for the shuttle van a the nearby Metro rail station despite giving more than 15 minutes (the requested amount of time) notice and making repeated followup calls. Also, the lone elevator was out of order throughout our 3-evening stay - making checking in and checking out more difficult.	3.0
Thought this spot was great. Clean room and bathroom with excellent shower. Updated bathroom was very nice. Front help was efficient and friendly. Breakfast gal was hard working and helpful. My husband and I stayed only one night as we were passing through but if I were staying longer this hotel would be the place to stay. Clean, convenient and... More	5.0
Bad: The 'bathroom' area was open to the sleeping area. It was a unique design and certainly made the room seem larger. It was just a little odd. Also had to be careful about not hitting my head on the edge of the TV that was mounted on the wall between the sleeping area and the bathroom area. Good: The room was very spacious and the bed was quite comfortable. We were only there for the night but it was a pleasant stay.	4.0
Took almost twenty minutes to check in says it's a ramada has different brand everywhere carpet in hallway looks like a murder scene. Not happy at all. By the way I will take pic of bathtub check it out. 99.00 rooms. Tried to use the phone from the early 20's but no dial tone.	1.0

This was the first hotel we have ever stayed at that felt like you were sleeping inside of a walk-in closet the room had no window at all and was very claustrophobic we stayed in room 1701 and apparently from speaking to the front desk over 1/3 of the hotels rooms or exactly like this king room I feel that the hotel should forewarn you of these fax however they do not the staff was very friendly and accommodating the room was just not up to par like other Aloft hotels we have stayed at We do have 21 King rooms in the hotel that do not have a window and while they will run you the same price as our traditional kings, there is an option to choose this room. Be sure to check your confirmation when booking to ensure you've selected the correct room. We are thrilled to hear the staff was accommodating and we will be sure the front desk is confirming room types at check in.Thanks for your business, we hope you'll be back,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager	3.0
We stayed at Konea tower facing the beach. The amenities provided by this resort was great from full kitchen, Bosch dishwasher, washer and dryer furnished with detergent everyday. Great for couples and especially families. The concierge service was excellent as well, helped us planned our first trip to Maui. We will return.	5.0
Bad: Couldn't find fault with anything. Good: It might sound strange to say that I was ill in bed for most of my stay but still gave the hotel top ratings!. However, the room was extremely comfortable and clean. The staff were very helpful and pleasant and the location was great. We were in the annex which fronts onto Ocean Drive and there was a very good cafe/bar below. I found out towards the end of the stay they also did room service. Wish I had been well enough to take advantage of this great little hotel.	5.0
This is a nice LaQuinta hotel. We came back from Bearazona wildlife park after going there with our dogs Timmy and Peanut. They were so understanding about getting us a room as close to a door on the first floor as possible. The rooms are clean with a fridge and a microwave in it. We are booked in February again for our road trip back to Las Angeles.	5.0
Bad: Provided breakfast is just bagels and doughnuts + tea/coffee. I'm not sure how that qualifies as continental! Beds are very small but OK for a relatively small couple - would be uncomfortable if you are much over 6 feet. Rooms are small but that's the only way you are getting a room at this price in this location. Good: Location is excellent (we walked everywhere including from Boston Back Bay station to the hotel with our bags - it's a 10min walk), staff were friendly, rooms are small but reasonably well appointed, hotel and rooms were very clean.	4.0
Home 2 was a nice hotel to stay at, and the staff were respectful and delightful. The room was clean and spacious, the appliances and technology.

The refrigerator and the microwave were... More	4.0
Great staff at this hotel. It's in a nice location too. The hotel is dated, but I very much enjoyed the breakfast at Denny's (ask for Ceci) as Best Western will give rewards members a free breakfast or 6.00 off another breakfast entree at Denneys. Bertha was fantastic as check in. She accommodated my special requests and took me to 3 rooms to let me decide as I told her I was super picky. Pierre and Michael and Darby were also super kind and helpful. Michael is very knowledgeable about wineries. Darby helped me with restaurants, and Pierre was also helpful and offered any additional assistance he could. Pierre had coffee made SUPER early which is great as I was up at 4 or 4:30 each day. It was nice he was there to greet me and there was decaf and coffee made early. They need to update the rooms, but the business center was nice with 2 computers and the exercise room and laundry facility was all right there too--super convenient. The price was high, but I guess all the prices are high at Napa. I'd recommend the location too. Thanks!	4.0

Hotel was fine and met needs. Nice amenities in king size room. Room was also a good value for price. Room had nice amenities except it lacked any blankets on bed or available in room. Bed only had a sheet (no comforter or blanket). Many people prefer to keep room cool, but have a blanket to keep warm while sleeping. Excellent breakfast.	3.0

Second time in a row that we have had an awful experience with the hotel booked through your website. Your website gave the hotel 3.2 stare. I would agree if the scale was out of 100, not 5. One of the two queen beds had the mattress springs bulging through surface. The bathroom was dirty and I killed 3 roaches.	1.0
went for a nature getaway. I am disabled and really loved the spacious room that I could get my mobility scooter around in. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They even wash the blankets and covers for each new guest!!And I didn't hear any noise coming from other rooms.	5.0
Arrived early to combat traffic. Despite knowing that check-in was 4 pm, I asked that morning about the possibility of an early check-in and was told absolutely not. I returned about 3 pm to find many people checking in ahead of the 4pm deadline I was given. The carpets are worn and aging rapidly, the walls need a new coat of paint desperately. The staff was pleasant if not a little understaffed. It was a holiday weekend but this hotel is not worth the premiums they are charging.	3.0
This hotel is great! The amenities are really nice. The bathrooms are nice, and have the best showers of any hotel I have ever stayed at. I'll certainly stay here again. All the staff is fantastic. Teri and Charlie during Kickback are especially fantastic and help to make your stay fun.	5.0

Great location to visit Sedona. Hotel offers great views of the mountains all around the city and good facilities. Rooms are what you should expect from a hotel of this type. Being very central, you have very easy access to restaurants and shopping.	4.0
We chose this hotel based on the price and location. It certainly lived up to our expectations. It was by far the best value for money I could find with most other hotels almost double. Given we would be out and about most days we just wanted something decent we could get a good sleep in and was clean.River Hotel check in was quick and easy. After a long flight we asked for a quiet room that had a great view when we woke up.We got a room with a view of the alley way and some kind of air con vents outside (1011). Whatever the air con thing was outside had a constant hum and it would drive anyone crazy.The air con in the room was the only thing noisier! Impossible to sleep with it on even with the supplied ear plugs. It's not the city noise that's the problem it's these two things.We loved the free filtered water and bottles.So overall looking back on this trip I think the value and location win out ever so slightly. Maybe a different room would make a difference to this review overall of the hotel.	4.0
We loved this hotel, it was a little further away from the hustle and bustle of the quarter which was perfect for us. We was in town for the football game so it was right in our budget for a quick overnight stay. The hotel was clean, beds were comfy, and everyone was super polite.	5.0
Bad: The room we stayed in has a window was facing an alley. We were woken up at 3 am by the garbage truck and they were there until 5.30 AM picking trash from the entire alley, not a good idea for light sleepers. The hotel should invest a bit in better soundproof windows. Good: Good spread of breakfast. Friendly staff Great shower and toiletries	4.0

I stayed here with my family for my daughters wedding. It had a very accommodating staff, Olivia was excellent. The rooms were very well maintained. Would highly recommend this hotel, especially if your wedding venue is Celebrations at the Bay!	5.0
I havw stayed at this hotel several times and the staff is pleasant and the rooms are clean. However, every time I stay there is usually a proble with the air conditioner or the heater. Each time maintenance has to fix it. I don't understand why the first nigjt I have to sleep sweating or cold because the air or heat is not working properly. I think the hotel must control the utilities from a central unit and they do not adjust the temperature for you until you complain. Otherwise, the hotel is lovely. Expect to pay a whopping 32 per night for parking. Unbelievable!	4.0

Had planned a family trip well in advance. Made reservation through hotels.com. Knew hotel would be full - called the evening of reservation to let them know we were about an hour out. Front desk staff was rude, said I did not reserve with charge card and was ready to give my room away - I insisted she check records. she then admitted she was wrong and the room was already paid for. Upon arrival, nobody at the front desk - had to wait. understaffed for such a busy night. once in our room, discovered they gave us a king bed for 3 adults - had to go track down a cot since there was no other room to switch to. staff was short with me and my family. said we should have known to call the front desk when making the reservation, etc. etc - pretty much blaming us for not doing a better job with making reservations. Hotel is in decline with repairs needed (broken door locks, broken gym equipment, broken machine in breakfast area, clogged toilet, broken clock in gym, filter not working in pool adequately, etc.) Housekeeping had rooms clean, but common areas needed more attention. Towels in gym and pool area were low in stock. staff in breakfast area was very attentive and pleasant. Seems more staffing/attention to detail would generally bring things back up to snuff. It is close to traffic - and right next to a fire station. Ask for a room in the back if you can!	3.0
If you don't mind staying in an old hotel for one night for a low rate, then you won't mind staying here. However, this hotel is something from the 1960s and needs alot of updates. Was clean though.	3.0
The room was very nice. Even had a microwave as well as fridge. Big screen tv. The only negative in my room was the toilet seat. I had to have someone come clean it and they were right on it.	5.0
We were welcomed with cold drinks and a smiling friendly receptionist and manager as we looked tired after walking from the station. They asked why we had not rung for the shuttlebus (we tried but we had called the wrong number). We always used it since (the driver was NOT the smiling type). The continental breakfast was nearer a full breakfast as there were some cooked items.	5.0
This is a typical Courtyard. Hotel lobby was nice and the staff were very helpful and friendly. It was a little difficult to find. Located behind the Steak and Shake.

We didn't stay overnight, but rented the room so that my daughter and her friends could get ready for prom a few blocks away. Just so everybody knows...her dad and I were in the room at ALL times; no kids were left unsupervised. Her date needed a place to get ready because he had performed at a nearby arts event that ran right into Prom time, so he needed someplace close. The staff was wonderful and very accommodating. We got some really wonderful pictures; my favorite was when the kids were reaching for the chandelier and it looked like they were reaching for falling stars. The staff helped us stage some really cool shots, and were just fantastic. The room was very clean and comfortable with plenty of mirror space and plug ins for curling irons; the window added lots of good, natural light. Lots of closet space let the kids get ready for after prom without too much problem.The only negative I have is that the hotel shuttle was not available, although when I called earlier in the week to make sure it was, I was assured that it would be available and that I didn't need a reservation. We had to scramble for rides to prom, which worked, but was a last minute stress we hadn't planned on having.	4.0

Our family of four stayed at this hotel for a night. The room had a king size bed w/ sofa bed. The room was small. the room was renovated recently but it didn't feel like it. The place was still under construction. Breakfast was very ordinary , Juice machine was not working and staff had hard time keeping up with the refilling food stuff that were being consumed by the hotel guests.Dear Sdtourist,Thank you for taking the time to review your stay, we do our best to execute exceptional customer service and we clearly did not during your stay.

Stayed here after a day visiting the Gulf Coast beaches. It was easy to find with many restaurants and other stores in the area. The staff was friendly and pleasant. The room was spacious and clean.

If you are looking for a hotel with a cool Miami-style vibe in a central location, this might be the place for you. The hotel is located right on the main drag (Duval street) so it's close to restaurants, drugstores, bars, etc. You can walk to everything from the hotel. The downside to the location is that it is close to Duval. We were in a room that was close enough to Duval that you could hear partying way into the night. After having difficulty sleeping the first night (noise until about 3 am) we asked to moved the next morning, the person at the front desk entertained the idea but was not able to come through. An apology or at least some empathy would have been nice (for example, Oh, I'm sorry the noise kept you up). That was not the case. The response was, At least you're not in rooms xxx and xxx because those are right on Duval. Not what I expected from a place like this and also because we are platinum members of the hotel chain. The pool area is small but lovely with its zen motif and trees in the background. The rooms were also pretty hip and the toiletries very nice. The hotel staff was fine...cordial..but not friendly or terribly accommodating. The free breakfast perk for platinum members was a parfait (fine but not up to par with other hotels in the brand). I might have taken the points and paid for the breakfast instead. At the least they should give you a credit to apply to something else. The bikes on the property were GREAT! We also enjoyed outstanding drinks at the stylish hotel bar. Overall, we had an enjoyable stay and would probably choose the hotel again the next time we are in the keys. Thank you for taking the time to write a detailed review of your stay with us. We are glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay aside from some of the issues that you mentioned. We are disappointed to hear about some of the issues you had and we will be sure to address them. We do hope you will return and allow us the opportunity to provide you with a perfect stay.	4.0
Passing through Tn. And had to stop somewhere for the night. It was part of the choice hotel deal so we thought maybe the rooms are nicer on the inside than the outside since they spent a small fortune on advertising billboards. The room was absolutely depressing. Desperate need of updating. Walls were cracked and dirty. The bathroom had fixtures... More	1.0
My stay was good. I recommended the hotel to a friend because we were vacationing together. Her room had a strong smell and we were told it was coming from the pipes under the kitchenette sink. After complaining she was moved. She was offered several other rooms but they were dirty. The carpet and bathrooms look horrible. After she was shown several, (about 10 rooms) she settle on the cleanest she could find. I know you're a franchise, but when you using the Marriott name the hotel should be cleaner. Need another toaster. Only one toaster for the entire hotel. My eggs were cold before my bagel/bread was toasted. I was my second time there. I would stay there again. Hope I will never have the same problems as my girlfriend.	4.0

The lodge has the basic amenities. TV, Bathroom. Bed and small coffee pot. It was sufficient for the most part. My husband and I would of liked a small fridge or somewhere we could store some ice.

We stayed for 5 nights, and we were extremely pleased. It's not a new building, but it is well maintained. What we were most pleased about was the breakfast buffet! It was a true buffet (not just pre-wrapped pastries)--Eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon, waffles, cereal, fruit, bagels, toast, etc. This saved us a lot of money, because we could start the day with a hearty meal. Additionally, Stacy at the front desk was very helpful with all kinds of information. I highly recommend this hotel! We hope to stay there again in August.	5.0
Very nice hotel. Easy check in and out. Friendly staff. Very Clean room and if you want quiet ask to be on the south side of the building. Close to restaurants and shopping. Would definitely stay there again.	4.0
When all hotels in DC are over 250 during the week of the National Prayer Breakfast, it's so nice to have an affordable hotel near the Metro with complimentary breakfasts and DCA shuttles. Will definitely stay here again.	5.0
MIXED FEELING ABOUT THIS MOTEL Travel up to Billings MT on Sunday 1/24/16 and made reservation through choice. At that time reserved the room with choice points in the amount if 12,000 choice points.

Stayed 1 night. Room was very clean, very quiet, staff very friendly. A+. Location was good. Felt safe. Breakfast very good and efficient. Pool and hot tub very nice often long drive. Keep up the good work. Will be back. View of Goodyear factory after restoration was awesome. American historic buildings are so cool when refurbished and reutilized.	5.0
My hubby and I first stopped here on July 28 and this is our 3rd time back since. We love the bloody Mary's and the food has been great every time. They have just recently started to serve breakfast and it was very good. We will be back... Obviously.	5.0
superb hotel. Can't go wrong with location, comfort or worth the money you spend for it. With breakfast buffet and afternoon reception you can't go wrong with meeting everyones wants. the rooms are comfortable and quiet. We were by the elevator and couldn't not here the elevator and traffic coming or going. Free transportation to local restuarants, metro and airport was just another bonus. All hotel personnel were top notch ..very friendly, helpful and efficient. Couldn't be happier with our trip and accommodations.	5.0
I booked this hotel through a major web site. I was told I would get a king size bed, smoking room with refrig, microwave coffee maker. When I got there the man at the desk said I get a smoking room with 2 double beds, He said thats what the web site sent to them. I dont believe that, he wouldnt show me. So I had to take it. The elevator sounded like it was on its last leg. The carpets were filthy, no coffee maker, the mattresses and boxed springs must of been 10 yrs old very uncomfortable, even holes in the sides, pillows felt like shredded foam and to make matters worse, there were cob webs all up the walls and corners by the sink. The television was old in a huge coffin like tv stand, no channel guide, no dresser and no comfortable chairs. For a few dollars more I will go across the street next time.	2.0
We had a 2bed room suite. It was clean loved the kitchenette although we didnt use it. Close to Hwy, shopping and resturants. 35 minutes from ORF airport. There was no real decor(pictures vases etc). The staff was friendly and very helpful. I would definately stay there again!	4.0
Room was very clean ! They have a breakfast room ! Toast,bagels,cereal, juice, hardboiled eggs ! The have instant coffee ! Not a big fan of instant coffee ! Was reasonable priced ! Spent three nite !

Great stay overall, the room was supposed to have a balcony but it wasn't open. Will definitely go again if we get the chance though.	5.0
My husband and I just completed a stay here and really loved it. The staff could not be more accommodating. Kitchens are really kitchens equipped a working oven. We barbequed steaks on the outside grill by the pool. However, do this before the sun goes down. There isn't much light in that area after dark. We did have small red ants upon arrival and they moved us to another, more expensive room without charge. Fantastic staff. This is really the only place to stay.	5.0
We spent 3 nights at this hotel. Room was excellent, large king suite with flat screen TV, fridge and microwave. We liked the dispensers in the shower for shampoo, conditioner and soap.

We were a group of three couples in our fifties who were on a 10 day wine trip in Northern California. We spent three nights at the Best Western Inn at the Vines. It was clean, breakfast was convenient and the location was fine.The best part of the stay was the help we received from the front desk by Bridget. She was more than willing to answer questions, make suggestions for things to do, places to visit, and she offered restaurants choices.	4.0
This was a very good hotel for our family. The management kept us together on the same floor and was very resposive to any needs we had. The continental breakfast was very acceptable. The business center was very easy to access while we were there. It is well located as to access to the interstates and has many good resturants close by. The Metro is close and very easy to access. I would have no qualms using this again the next time we are in the area.	4.0

I recently stayed at the beautiful Hotel Royal and it was great! The room was clean, the staff was friendly and the location was fantastic!

We were in town for a Lego League Competition at UTEP. We reserved the hotel for the pool. And of course, it was closed for maintenance when we checked in. It did open the next day, but the pool was why we chose to pay 40 more per night. Service was ok- not outstanding, but not bad either. Just normal service. There were only about 10 channels on the TV and nothing for kids (so I had no pool or TV for the first night after a long day of work and traveling). But the hotel is close to a shopping center and not too far from UTEP so it worked well for what we needed.	4.0
Great place to stay if you want to go to DC The room was very good, we had a welcome gift waiting in our room which was very nice. The staff was very helpfull and gave us at check-in unasked very usefull info about the surrounding area and ways to travel within DC. Our room was on the opposite side of the highway and onthe 2nd floor with no highway noise. The hot breakfast (eggs, waffles, grits, oatmeal, etc.) is very good and the same everyday but there is enough of a variety. The shuttle will take you anywhere within 3 miles and to the DC Metro station, all you have to do is call and they will pick you up as well. The pool is very clean and all day there's a lifeguard, the pool was a great way to cool off after walking all day around DC!	5.0
Bad: The remote in our room did not work for the Television so we had to manually get up and change the channels. There were not as many facilities as we had in previous hotels Oceanfront and the cost was much more expensive then those hotels. The stay was much more convenient at the previous hotels than this one. Swimming pool is to small. . Good: It was very close to the beach within walking distance. Room had balcony so we were able to catch the breeze from the Ocean. Room was clean. Free guest parking. Complimentary Breakfast was great. Whirlpool was place to relax/enjoy as a spa you could say.	4.0

We hadn't stayed at the St. Regis for many years. We decided to try it again for a 2 night stay to celebrate our anniversary. We were upgraded to a larger suite than we had reserved. It was a beautifully appointed room with all the modern amenities. It was a smart room that had all the controls for the lighting and draperies from either room.We had a beautiful view of 5th avenue from our living room. The room came with butler service which was a great amenity.The best part of the St. Regis besides the wonderful rooms is definitely the location. You step out of the hotel and you're in the middle of a shopper's paradise. Every designer store is at your doorstep. So if you want to shop till you drop it's a great location. You're also steps away from Central Park and all the wonderful museums we have in New York City.The St. Regis has it all, great service, beautiful rooms and a perfect location. Looking to return soon to enjoy being in the city!Dear MissS85, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your special occasion. Happy Anniversary and many more happy years to come!On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels which we pride ourselves on.Thank you for your time in reviewing our property on TripAdvisor, and please let us know when you will be returning, as we would love to have you as our guest.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager	5.0
You can't beat this hotel because it is right on the beach. It is mid beach so away from the hectic and trashy south beach vibe. If you want to escape the incessant pounding music and Kardashian wannabes of the SOuth Beach hotels and neighboring Eden Roc of Fountainbleau then this is a great option. But also don't expect the service of any of these adjacent properties. THe service here is minimal at best. You wait forever at breakfast if you order off the menu. The doormen are non existent as is a concierge. THere is no room service and the food is mediocre. Terrible service out by the pool with a limited menu. No beach chairs - you have to pay an outside vendor. The bathroom was so tiny we could open the door less than halfway because it hit the toilet. Two people trying to use it was like a circus maneuver. It can't possibly be code. There are plastic cups for drinking - no glass but the bed was comfy and the flat screen TV was great. THe staff is not that helpful and the balcony's seem old and in need of paint. We had a gorgeous view but the balconies are interconnected with a rail between them. Our neighbor chain smoked on his balcony which made sitting out extremely unpleasant. That said if you get a good price is really worth it because it is on the beach and that is why I went to Miami Beach in the first place.	4.0
The hotel is safe and basic. The good points are the hot tub. The rooms are old and need remodeled. They have the basic dark walls and dark bedspread and really old bathroom.

We are regular Marriott clients, have rarely been disappointed. This was a very disappointing occasion. First, the room was not ready when we arrived, the desk clerks were either rude or lacked experience and knowledge, but at the least were not accommodating.

Great hotel, well kept but the room had some strange bad smell, no big deal. Only problem we had a baby with us and had requested a crib at least five days before, and when we got there they said they did not have any available, not safe at all to sleep with the baby in our bed. Otherwise the rest was ok.	4.0
I've stayed at this hotel several times and this was the BEST stay that we've EVER had here. It has been so cleaned up and is now very comfortable.	5.0
Hair all over place, shower curtain rod broken and couldn't keep closed, water went all over floor, insense sticks sticking out vent and cover burnt, hair dryer didn't work, wrong insert for coffee non usable, room didn't get cleaned at all next day. Staff not knowledgeable at front desk, housekeeping was told to come to room and never showed. Maintenance did show and was ok but not the most interactive. Front desk no apologies given. 1 of our worst stays ever.	1.0
I was told at check in there is a 7.00 per day charge for your vehicle for parking. I did not mind this but it is not explained to you on the information of the hotel when booking. The real problem I had was that I had absolutely no hot water to shower with in the morning when I was getting ready for work. I called the front desk and received NO consideration at all. I am a vietnam veteran and I swore I would never take another cold shower so I had to go to work without bathing. NOT FUN!!!!!!!!!!! I paid for breakfast when I reserved the room but I did not receive any coupon at check in and was not told I needed one. After getting dressed, I went to the breakfast area but was not allowed in because I did not have a coupon. I WAS SO UPSET AT THIS POINT THAT I JUST CHECKED OUT AND LEFT. I expressed my feelings to the front desk and they said they could not do anything for me because no one from mainteanace was at work yet. This all happened between 5:45 AM and 6:30 AM	1.0

We had a good stay in this hotel, it was clean and comfortable, everything was ok as far as the basic services, but the wireless internet did not work well at all during our 6 day stay.

Clean and well maintained, convenient to the airport, a half mile walk to any stores, staff friendly. Would stay again for airport access but it's definitely not quiet with all the highway noise.	4.0
Well, on a whole the room was clean and the bed was comfortable but the fitted top sheet kept coming off on both sides of our bed. The TV was very good, it had a frig and microwave which we always appreciate. The room was 122 and I could hear the traffic (hubby sleeps with ear plugs), I had to keep the fan on the air conditioner on to drown out the noise. WiFi was great. Breakfast, we grabbed a couple bananas, coffee and left as it was really sparse.	3.0

Arrived to find our room had a broken air-conditioner, the shower curtain rod was coming out of the drywall and the bathroom fan sounded like a jack hammer. the maintenance person could not fix the AC, there were no other rooms available, the windows did not open and it was like an over in the room. The staff did not offer to pay for us to room elsewhere etc due to the inconvenience. I would not recommend this facility. It was in disrepair. And as we were standing at the desk, a couple with 3 small children came in with a confirmation email and there reservation had been cancelled, so they had no room at all.	1.0

My fiance and I stayed here to go the Nationals games Friday and Saturday nights. The hotel is very close to the metro and made it easy to get to the ballpark and the zoo. The free champagne was a nice touch to start our trip. Only negative is that if you use the wifi and are not a Rita Carlton rewards member they charge you 9.95 per day. I asked about this charge and they promptly refunded it since we were only using it to check emails on our phones and could have used our data had we known it was that expensive. Otherwise a very nice hotel with excellent staff that make your experience enjoyable.	4.0

I had stopped by here with my family just to stop by. We did not stay, but rather wanted to see this new property. It is near the Napa River. There is also a Century theater and an In-Shape in the same parking lot. The grounds were immaculate. Once I walked in, all I could say was WOW!. It was beautiful, modern and I felt comfortable as I walked in. We purchased some waters from the gift shop as we were driving around through Napa, Calistoga, and St. Helena. Kalah (I believe that was her name- she had curly brown hair), was so warm upon us walking into the lobby. I asked if I could take a look around just to see what the common areas looked like, she said absolutely! It was beautiful. I am looking forward to my future stay(s) here. I will say as I passed a young lady, Danielle. It was like she did not want to be there or she was having an off day. She did not acknowledge me as a guest as she passed by or even at the desk. Overall still 5 Stars. Kalah (hopefully that was her name) was AWESOME! See you Soon!Dear LeMoura G,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. Your comments especially the Wow are bells to my ears. We truly do have a unique Hampton capturing the Napa Valley throughout the building. It was very satisfying to hear your awesome comments about Kalah. We look forward to seeing you on your next visit to the Napa Valley. Thank you, Serina Najar.	5.0

My recent three day stay at the Virginian Suites in Arlington was pleasant enough, but it could have been so much better if the facility was simply updated with some relatively minor interior design modifications that would give it a fresh 2014 look. Adding some color to the walls, fabrics finishes, and beginning the process of incremental replacement of furnishings would elevate the hotel to the next level without breaking the bank, and allow the hotel to keep its very affordable rates intact. The location was great, in that it was a short walk or drive to much of Arlington's riverfront, the downtown commercial center, the METRO station, and the Key Bridge and Georgetown. The hotel is located on 1 mile from Interstate 66, so vehicular access was great. The beds were very comfortable, but the rooms were underwhelming from a design standpoint. The only problem I encountered was that air conditioning unit seemed a bit undersized. Overall, it was a very nice place to sleep, and I would stay there again, especially if cost were an issue.	3.0
Would recommend overall. We were there in January and the weather was very cold. We expected outside to be cold. The hotel's entrance doors were open a lot, tho, and that made the restaurant and seating ,common areas too cold to enjoy. Happy hour cold, breakfast cold Poor concierge employees very cold.

Last second decision to visit Baltimore. We were greeted by Marq, a pleasant young man, who upgraded us to a king suite. She even provided us discounted tickets to the aquarium when we checked out the following day. The room was very spacious, clean and quiet. (Our room was close to the elevators but we didn't eben noticed it). The location of the hotel is central to the inner harbor offerings and to Little/Italy and Fells landing. There are many upscale stores nearby to browse as well as many fine restaurants. The gym was fine to work a quick sweat. Breakfast included was decent but nothing to rave about. Overall, the staff was very courteous and the hotel had a modern edge look which suited us just fine. Marq was the superstar during our stay. HIgh recommendation.	5.0

Overall I enjoyed my stay in this hotel. The staff were very courteous and helpful at all times. I had to ask to be moved after my first night - my original room smelled very musty - I thought it was cigarette smoke even though it was a non-smoking hotel. They promptly moved me the following day to a much nicer room on the 10th floor. I must say though, I thought it was a bit inappropriate that, on the morning when I was moved, one male member of staff (at least I thought) was very condescending to another staff member in front of me - insisting several times that she call housekeeping to clean my previous room straight away (he could've waited until I wasn't standing there) as she had her hands full trying to move me to a different room. Aside from that though - all of the other members of staff were first class. The furniture was a bit dated as well, however for a budget(ish) hotel, it was more than adequate. Good water pressure too in the shower.	3.0

I agree, the staff experience makes all the difference. Our staff here is stellar and I will make sure to share these kind words with all of them. We look forward to your next visit. Thank you again - Genafer, Director of Sales	5.0
I had a wonderful stay at this hotel. From the time I arrived the customer service I received has been nothing less of truly amazing. All the way from the staff that checked me in to the staff at the bar during happy hour. The shuttles are great if you dont have a car they will take you to/from the airport, to/from the mall and anywhere requested within a mile radius of the airport. The room its self can use a bathroom update but overall not too bad. The breakfast was great with cooked to order omelets. This hotel was worth every penny.	5.0
The hotel was undergoing renovations and we did have a problem with the water leaking from the second floor on us as we were on the first floor. The kids loved the pool and the breakfast was very nice. They let you in the breakfast area all day which is very nice for late night snacks for the kids and drinks for the adults. The shuttle to the metro station to catch the subway into DC was very nice and they pick you up as well. I know some folks complain that the last pick up is at 9 pm, but since the DC mall exhibits close at 6 pm it was not a problem. Due to the price of the metro I would recommend the travel time to start on or after 9:30 am	4.0

The staff are friendly and they made sure check in and out went smooth. The room is a little dated and muggy, but it has a nice bed and was clean.

This Rodeway Inn was recently converted from a TLC. For some reason the people who worked there wouldn't admit it had been a very recent change.

Das Mill's House Hotel ist fr mich ein typisches durchschnittliches Stadthotel. Das Zimmer war eher klein aber mit guten Betten. Die Einrichtung war hbsch, ausreichend und sauber. Da das Zimmer zum Innenhof lag war es sehr ruhig; der Pool war geschlossen, obwohl es zum Baden noch warm genug gewesen wre.Das Restaurant hatte die Grsse einer Bahnhofshalle und hat uns nicht zum Bleiben 'verfhrt'. Gerade nebenan gab es ein wundervolles Restaurant mit guter Bedienung und gutem Essen.Die Bar bzw. die Lobby und auch der Innenhof mit seinem Brunnen sieht gemtlich und einladend aus.Das Hotel liegt ideal fr alle Sehenswrdigkeiten in Fussgnger-Nhe. Empfehlenswert ist der Gang ber die Kingsstreet mit seinen vielfltigen Lden und der Besuch der Villengegend im French-Quarter. Nicht besuchenswert ist der 'Market' - eine reine Touristenfalle.Wer nur kurz in Charleston verweilt, kann dieses Hotel als Ausgangsstation buchen - ich kann es empfehlen.Nebenbei: Savannah ist hnlich wie Charleston aber lebendiger und vielfltiger. Ich wrde vermutlich eher in Savannah ein Hotel suchen und lnger bleiben, und Charleston nur im Vorbeifahren besichtigen.	5.0
The hotel is just one of many that are on this new trend of firmer pillows and mattresses. This is the third hotel I have stayed in the last few months that have had firmer vs softer mattresses in their rooms. Aside from the bed The room was well appointed, comfortable and really The bonus Those super plushy and comfy robes in the closet. I miss a good hotel robe and this one had one!! Another little thing I loved was the spa water and coffee service in the lobby. High quality coffee and the New York Times Count me in! The maid service was friendly, attentive, and I even got a little note. Would totally stay again.	5.0
We have stayed here 3 times in the past year. Since my first review, the wifi has been better and some of the rooms now have upgraded furniture, so that is nice.

I got a 'thank you for staying with us' email with the above words in it. On my last trip I had just left the Suncoast and was talking to a slot attendent at the Mirage who also likes the Suncoast. He asked why I liked it so much and I said I did not know - now I know - I feel so comfortable here. I stay at the Suncoast for 2-3days every 2months as part of a longer10-11 day holiday. It is not the Strip but it is still a nice casino - a locals casino with bowling, a cinema and bingo hall. But it also has a conference centre / banuet hall. You do not look out over the Strip but you can look out over a golf course and their nice pool area. When I stay on the Strip I actually ask for a Mountain View room - rather than a view of McDonalds and Walgreens! Even though I am a semi regular I am treated as a local. If I room charge I do not need to show ID - that's OK - we know you. The Cocktail waitresses even remember what I like to drink. They like my English accent! I had changed the dates of mt stay and the receptionist spotted that my dining credit had not been carried over so she corrected that. They now have sofas for the rest of your party can rest while you sign-in. The area is smoke-free - for those not used to casinos but I still say I do not recognise the casino as being smokey. I like the buffet for breakfast (8.50 inc tax) but then Du-Pars for Dinner where I can sit and have the food brought to me. The wine is 5 a glass 4-7pm - a nice end to the day. I'm interested in trying PengZu. The menu is on the Suncoast website and has some interesting dishes that attract this 61yo white guy. For burgers etc they have The Game sportsbar or the bowling alley snack bar - I have enjoyed both. Some days I do not feel hungary but I am tired so I get a Subway and a bottle of wine from the Gift shop (Glen Ellen Cabenet 4) and retire to my room. There is a refrigerator in the room. Du-Pars do the room service but the menu was missing from my room the last two trips. At some hotels that would be an issue but not at the Suncoast. My next trip will be in May with a suite at NYNY, a room at the Suncoast and a suite at the Mirage. I have asked for a Tuscany suite on eStandby. If I do not get it I will be happy with my 550sqft Suncoast room with floor to ceiling windows. I can get a bus from outside NYNY (or the airport) to the Suncoast for 2 - the Westcliffe Express (WAX). The bus can take me back to the Strip and somedays it has taken me to Downtown to visit the Suncoast's sister properties.Awesome! We love to see five-star experiences. We are glad our mission is fulfill through you experience with us! Thank you for visiting us! See you again, next time!	5.0
This is San Francisco in Silicon Valley, so when a hotel charges over 15 per night for internet access you expect a decent connection.

I'm very happy with that particular hotel! The room was very neat and clean, staff very friendly and willing to help in anyway possible.

I would highly recommend Days Inn Glen Burnie to everyone who is looking to stretch their vacation dollar and yet have fun and comfort of a higher class hotel!	5.0
The Embassy Suites Crystal City is a nice hotel, the closest one to the Pentagon. They will drive you to the Pentagon in their shuttle but you have to walk across the whole parking lot to get to the entrance. If it is raining or snowing that might be a uncomfortable walk. The walk to the Metro is the longest in Crystal City but still not too bad, about 5 blocks. Their shuttle is great, they will drop you off to restaurants or the metro, but you might have to wait a bit to get a ride. My only issue are they do not have enough smoking rooms - they always say they are full and they have plenty of rooms and floors to add smoking rooms and it is pricy - but that is to be expected in DC.	4.0
Nice place for the price. Great staff	4.0
This is a family owned operation. The owners themselves see to your needs. Dan Jenson even helped us carry our luggage to the room when we arrived. We stayed in the Penthouse, which was phenomenal.

Staff very friendly and rooms very nice. One problem with room above us having a party and very loud, had to call front desk at 2:45 a.m. and again at 3:15 a.m. before they were able to get them to quiet down. Otherwise, good experience and again a wonderful staff.	3.0

Unfortunately the furnature and decor is from the late 1960s or early 1970s and it also appears it hasn't been kept up since then. They allow pets but unless everything else is booked, as it was for me, I will not return to this place.	1.0

This hotel was in a great location--very convenient for a visit to Cornell. The prices were reasonable, and it was very nice to have a free breakfast and free coffee. The breakfast included eggs and homefries, as well as yogurt etc. Also, there was free coffee at all times of the day and night!	4.0

This is an older property but it's clean. Nothing fancy, and I wouldn't recommend this for more than a night, but it was fine for what we needed. Breakfast was okay - more cold carbs than anything else! There is a Denny's in the parking lot as a back-up!	3.0

Stayed in this hotel for a week. All-you-need to live located in one place. Great room with view on the Strip + fully automated smart room. Very comfortable bad. Staff is very helpful and friendly. Location is great - next to he Bellagio.	5.0
Bad: The parking garage is so hard to find. I passed it at least two times trying to find it. You also can't self park, which is a hassle coming back from being out and about. You have to rush to gather all of your belongings, souvenirs, etc, because the entry bay to the garage will hold two cars at most. You can't dilly dally. Hope that makes sense. Only paid WiFi,which was a big bummer. The express snack bar/grill staff were very unfriendly. Every time I went to the buffet, the line to be seated was always sooo long. I never did end up eating there for that reason. Good: Near all of the Fremont Street Experience stuff.	3.0
We had a great time. Everyone we met was super nice. Lots of amenities. We enjoyed our stay.	5.0

I hate to give a bad review but this was such a bad experience i would hate for anyone to go through what i did. I booked a room for me and my other half for valentines day, got us a kingsize bed with a water view, got to check in at around 5 but told they over booked and no longer had my room available, keep in mind i booked my room a month ago... i was givin a room with two queen size beds that felt like a full Bad start to my romantic plans, after getting to our room we decided to go eat at the hotel restaurant fuego where we were greeted with a rude host that said since we had no reservation we had to sit inside, we said that fine yoy can see the water from anywhere inside it seemed, then she says its 95 per person but didnt tell us why just handed us the menu and said its the valentine menu. Already irritated from check in, now this chick, we changed our minds and said we can order room service... got some food that took an hour to arrive and it was not the best for 100, 3 tacos a quesadilla 2 salds and 2 cokes. We then decided to go for a walk that was nice with beautiful views, we started feeling good after some wine and craved a cigar... know there is no stores close by you have to go back accross the bridge in your car to get anything like that.

I love the Best Western Plus product. The rooms are always big and clean.This is my first visit to Napa, the area is beautiful. I picked this locating using my airline discount site which posted good reviews as well.The staff are very friendly and accommodating. We received a 3rd floor room above the lobby which afforded us a great view. Even though our balcony overlooked the road, we never heard any traffic noises. There is plenty of shopping and food options right across the street.We drove to downtown Napa and found plenty of great option for shopping and dining as well. I recommend going down there for good local flavor. I would discourage using your phone as your GPS to get around to various vineyards, we had two different maps going but kept losing our signal. Either bring your Garmen, etc. or ask the rental car agency for one just in case.Thank you for your detailed review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay.	5.0
The hotel was great. We drove in and our room was clean and comfortable. We enjoyed room service and the staff was great. Will stay here again when in Suffolk.	5.0
When we 1st arrived the staff was extremely friendly. The check in was swift as far as check ins go but they checked us in to an already occupied room. OMG! Can you imagine entering your room family in tow and there is someone sleeping in the bed. I was frighten, embarrassed and angry. We returned downstairs and the couple was already calling down about the intrusion. The staff apologized profusely and immediately gave us an empty room. Needless to say I had a hard time sleeping that night worried that someone might walk into our room but that never happened. The rest of the stay was worry free. The only other issue was the breakfast time. Breakfast at the Hyatt Place was from 6:30am-9am. That's awful early for people traveling with kids or on vacation. I'd like to take a moment to thank the staff. They were courteous and friendly especially Rosalind and Adriel. Thank you for a nice stay.	4.0

We enjoyed our stay at this suite hotel. The entire staff was very helpful and accommodating. The AC unit in our room needed repair, and within 5 minutes, a maintenance staff member promptly arrived and had it fixed within 30 minutes! The front desk staff were extremely helpful with directions to transportation, local grocery stores within walking distance, even printing our boarding passes for our flight home! Thank you all!	5.0
We've had a very pleasant stay at this hotel, great staff and forseen of all comforts, the rooms are not the biggest. We can definitly recommend people to stay here, we will definitly be back one day.	4.0
I really like the hotel, the location was nice. Definitely the best choice, last year I went to Colorado and we stayed in Denver at Hyatt hotel, the hotel was good but at Hyatt they charge for parking, breakfast and wifi, and at the Holiday Inn Express this all free. I will pickup the Holiday Inn Express again for future vacations.	5.0
Great price for the area. Dated room, but clean. Great wifi, ice machine very full. The continental breakfast consisted of donuts and toast with tang and coffee, but at least it's something. Located about 5 minutes from downtown. Friendly staff. I'd stay again!	4.0
This hotel almost exactly met my expectations. It's huge, has a beautiful setting, wonderful landscaping, and all the amenities you would expect from a giant resort. Also though, as you would expect from a mega resort, there is little personal attention, flexibility, and a general lack of attention to detail. We had an awesome room, Deluxe Ocean Suite, and would... More	4.0

This is the quietest hotel I have ever stayed in. A bit out of the way, but well worth the hunt. Everything was spotless, the tv was great.

Just have to give this hotel a thumbs up for making a great visit to the French Quarters even better.

The room was clean, everything was... More	5.0
I had a great stay. It was easy access to the interstate, as well as easy access into downtown DC. I must say I was disappointed with having to pay for parking. Overall breakfast was good, but on two different days I had to contact the concierge about sour dairy products. The problem was fixed, but it made me leary. Well rested nights. This is good deal.	4.0
Nice clean room, comfortable bed. The property was clean and well maintained. Nice breakfast. Friendly staff. Good value for the price.	4.0
I recently stayed at the Club Quarters while in Chicago for a family gathering. This hotel was a major disappointment for several reasons:1) They don't honor their commitments. I had reserved a room with a queen size bed through Expedia, but was given a room with two twin beds instead. The excuse: they ran out of bedspreads for queen size beds (how lame is that). 2) The elevator was unreliable. After checking in, myself and another guest were stuck on the first floor because of a malfunctioning card-reader in the elevator. The front desk staffperson fortunately was able to jiggle her card in a way that prompted the elevator to start moving. Not a good sign.3) The room reminded me of a depressing college dorm room. 4) The staff have no concept of customer service. On a prior visit, the staff were not willing to make any accomodations for a late checkout (even 15 minutes after the official checkout time - truly Kafkaesque). At checkout, no one has ever asked me whether I enjoyed my stay. Overall, the location is great, the rooms are clean and quiet, and all of the appliances work. But expect to be treated like a third-class citizen if you stay here.	1.0

The hotel was conveniently close to everything. It's close enough to walk downtown but far enough away to be quiet. Clean rooms, friendly staff, and a decent free breakfast made the stay enjoyable. The only negative was that the room I had was a little smaller than I'm used to. Next time I'll get a bigger room.	4.0

Came to town to bury my father in law in family plot. We had a total of seven people in three double rooms-we were all very comfortable. Breakfast was very good, hotel employees courteous and helpful. Only negative was the bathrooms were small. But, they were clean. Overall, value was great, room was clean, and we were in a safe part of town. We were on the highway side, which was a little noisy, but I had my earplugs. No one else was bothered by the noise. If you are a light sleeper, you may want to request a room not backed up to the highway. Hotel was great with accommodating all of our requests.	5.0

So you're on the road and reach Carrollton in early evening.

I stayed at Ritz-Carlton Hotel during my last visit.However, St. Regis is located right on the 5th avenue where I dropped by twice.Once for a afternoon tea at Astor Court, after a long busy day. Varieties of sandwiches and scones were nicely served, just like they do at Ritz, London, I skipped dinner on that evening.The next evening I dropped by to have light snack before evening play. The club sandwich was a simple menu but the most delicious I have had. The over all service is excellent.I would definitely stay at this hotel if it situated near the Central Park, like Ritz-Carlton.Dear spaniel12, On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we thank you for sharing the details of your recent visit to Astor Court on TripAdvisor.At The St. Regis New York, we pride ourselves on our personalized service, and we are so glad that you were able to experience this first hand.Please let us know when you will be returning to New York, as we would love to welcome you back as our guest.Sincerely,Octavia MargineanHotel Manager	5.0

The room was great!! We stayed in an Executive level room. The front desk staff wasn't very friendly. They had a lifeguard on duty at the pool all the time which was nice. The breakfast was very good with a nice variety of foods. It's very convenient to the metro. Free parking at the hotel was a plus. It is the last stop on the metro which at first we thought was a bad thing but ended up being good since we always had a seat in the morning on the way to D.C. Overall, I would recommend this hotel especially for the price. It's also very convenient to the Springfield Mall which is currently closed due to renovation but should open next year.	4.0
I am sitting in my room at the Suncoast as I write this reveiw to you, via high speed internet service provided by the hotel at a 9.99 fee. ( a bargin since I probably saved 100 over the 24 hour period, by using my computer instead of gambling!!)Trip advisor is my travelers bible. I was surprised at any negative comments about the Suncoast, but most were positve witch steered me to give it a try.We checked in Monday, Sept. 26 and will depart today Sept. 28.Since it is off season and during the week, we may have not experienced the heavey smoke ,bad service or disgrundled staff some have written about.The rooms are huge, bathrooms gigantic, and the beds are heavenly.(must be a coast hotel trait, Barbary coast has same beds)We booked through trip reservations , paid 44 a night, received a coupon book upon arrival that had a free luch buffet and other offers.The buffet was wonderful.We have stayed on the strip, done all the fancy dancy hotels and wanted to try someplace the locals recommended that had all the amenities we wanted for a decent price. We found it right here.This is video poker heaven!We ordered the American Casino Guideoff the internet which was filled with valuable gambling information and 2 for one coupons for rooms and food, and gamming. We used Suncoast coupons, and had a fabulous dinner buffet (Tues Filet Mingion ,Prime Rib Seafood etc) , 2 for 1 , saved 15., at the Rampart nex door.We are going to use a coupon and stay at the Las Vegas Club downtown on fremont street when we leave here. 49 for both nights or 59 for newer tower rooms.Another valuable sight is Cheapo Las vegas , which will critic everything down to the buffets in Vegas. Along with Trip Advisor, and American Casino guide ,our trip is just costing us mostly gambling expense.We are looking forward to trying the other Coast hotels because our experiences so far have been positive.So to some it up, if you want to get away from the strip, want a great place to stay, want to take in a movie (18 screen movie theater), comfy beds,decent price, high speed internet, perfect size workout room, great air conditioning, good food at great prices and on and on this is the place for you!Hope you have as much fun as we have had!!!	5.0

We stayed at Hyatt House Seattle Downtown for two nights. It is a convenient hotel with studio style rooms. It is well located right in front of the famous Space Needle. You have to walk about 15 minutes to Pike Place and the Centre but that is still very convenient. Breakfast was included, but we did not make use of it. They do have a small bar and Happy Hour in the lobby (we did not make use of that either but saw the sign). Staff is very friendly and helpful. It is one of those places where you get exactly what you paid for and know what to expect. Good space, comfy bed, big shower and anything you need to have a comfy stay. Only thing: the elevators are ridiculously slow we stood down waiting for one car to arrive what felt like ages. And we are happy to spend our last night there as well on our way back home.	4.0

I tend to be pretty loyal to Marriott brands and built up quite a bank of Marriott points, so when I went to book a room in Anaheim for a trip to Disneyland using my points I booked the Towneplace Suites for three reasons: (1) It was a much better value than any of the other Marriott properties in Anaheim, as it was a Category 3 for points redemption while the others were at least a Category 5.(2) It was the only Marriott property in Anaheim that did not charge a daily parking fee. (3) Free continental breakfast. I tend to be pretty cost conscious, so I would much rather fill up on a free hotel breakfast than pay for fast food or worse pay Disneyland food prices.I still had a few doubts, but I went into the stay with an open mind and wasn't disappointed. My biggest concern, the location in relation to Disneyland, ended up being a non-issue. The Anaheim Resort Transit shuttle ran like clockwork and I could be to the parks in less than 20 minutes. At a cost of only 12 for a three-day pass, it was much cheaper than parking at Disneyland and probably a good bit quicker as well. Even though the hotel isn't within walking distance of Disneyland I wouldn't hesitate to book again. The location was also a plus when I went to the Angels baseball game, as the stadium is about a half mile walk from the hotel. The room itself was more than adequate. The full size fridge and kitchenette with a dishwasher and stove was impressive but probably unnecessary for most hotel guests, however with the microwave and stocked dishes it would be very easy to prepare simple meals in the room to avoid the expense of eating out. The sleeping area was a totally separate bedroom which made it feel a little small, but it is probably about the same size as you would find in other Towneplace and other Marriott suite-style hotels. I think it is just the lack of openness that makes it feel small. Everything was nice and clean, no complaints there.I see that someone else complained about the breakfast, but I think it was as good as should be expected for free. I have seen fancier, but during my stay the breakfast included cereal (6 types), bagels, English muffins, yogurt, fresh whole fruit, instant oatmeal, and boxes of raisins (quite honestly I grabbed a few boxes each morning for snacks while in Disneyland). My only criticism would be to wait a little while longer to start shutting the breakfast area down, as 9:30am is still pretty early and most of these folks are on vacation after all.My only other complaint would be the toilet paper. I don't necessarily expect the nicest paper out there, but the stuff in my room was the roughest single-ply toilet paper I've ever seen. I think most gas station bathrooms have higher quality toilet paper than this. It just seems pretty ironic that while there was shampoo and conditioner by Paul Mitchell the hotel couldn't spend a little more for a decent two-ply. Overall I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel for anyone going to Disneyland or to an Angels games, although I may encourage them to bring their own TP.	4.0

Hotel is dated room was fine. Convenient for a race in downtown st. Louis for an out of tower. Was called several times prior to stay, and called after stay which got annoying.

I have never had this happen with any other hotel I have booked through here.	3.0
Had a terrible stay. I've stayed in many extended stays across the country and this one has shamed the brand. This hotel smelled, it was unclean, dark and cramped. The rooms were dated,my mattress didn't even have a fitted sheet I saw how nasty and disgusting the conditions of the mattresses. We didn't have any toilet paper in our room upon arrival.the room was less than mediocre. Towels were dingy and worn out. Fire detector was hanging on by a wire literally about to fall off the ceiling. hotel was in bad condition, was more like a motel.

I was happy to see the hotel was close to my destination. Disappointed, however, that there were spots on the bedspread and my travel companion found a dead bug on her pillow case. I asked her to call the front desk to tell them but she didn't want to. We also had to stop by the office to get a bath mat. I know I didn't pay a lot, but I would rather pay for peace of mind than to experience yuck.	3.0

Great Rates. Convenient Location with plenty of restaurants. Safe Neighborhood. Clean and Comfortable Rooms. Very Friendly Staff. That about does it for a guy like me looking for a low frills travel bargain. Sure you could do better for bigger coin, but you could definitely do a whole lot worse. I've stayed there twice, and just like Arnold, I'll be back.	4.0
Comfort Suites was so accommodating to us during our visit. We made an error and did not book the last night of our stay. Even tho they were fully booked for Saturday night, the staff did everything they could to successfully find us a room. Thank you again! Also, bedding and pillows are wonderful!	5.0
Booked this hotel due to proximity to Fedex Field only to realize it was 40 mins by metro. It would have been better to stay at a nicer hotel in a better area and take the metro from there.

This hotel is beautifully located in the NE corner of the French Quarter. It is one block to the trolley station on the newly completed Rampart Street line.

Enjoyed the stay at this Best Western in Redmond. Hotel prices were a little cheaper than the hotels in Bend which is only 15 minutes away.

When we checked in, we were told about rewards points. When I reviewed my Wyndham Rewards member number, it is zero. If possible, we do stay at your facility, mainly because of the location being very close to family.	3.0
Bad: The only thing I wish there could have been is hot food choices for breakfast, such as eggs and bacon or sausage. I did like how they set up the breakfast on each floor. That was very nice, however, having a place to eat outside of our room would be nice. But knowing there isn't anywhere to do that I think you do an excellent job with everything. We will definitely be coming back! Thank you. Good: The room and bathroom were spacious and very nice, very clean and updated. We stayed in the deluxe king room. Staff were all very nice and helpful!	5.0
The staff was very friendly. Facility was excellent for cleanliness and comfort. Beautiful pool and lounge area. This is a great facility for families or couples!

We had two rooms on the second floor. Even though the rooms were listed as non-smoking it was evident the rooms had been smoked in at some point in the past. When we talked to an employee about the smell and were told the second floor at one time was the smoking floor. The smell was evident in both rooms. It probably was more pronounced for us, because the occupants in both rooms have never been smokers. Other than the smoking smell the rooms were fine.	4.0

We were impressed at the thoughtfulness of the staff. There is a complimentary breakfast which starts at 7:00am but we left early so we would miss it. The staff offered us bagels and bananas to take with us on the road. A small but truly appreciated gesture. The room was large and comfortable. Good for traveling with a family. The only issue was that the bathroom door did not close well. We did not address this with the hotel as we were just there overnight.	4.0

What a bad mistake choosing this hotel. As a Platinum Marriott member, I thought that I could expect a certain minimum standard in service and accommodation. Man, was I wrong! Although I booked the least expensive room type, I expected a room upgrade, if available. The Marriott website showed a number of upgraded room types available, but the hotel refused to upgrade. I have never seen this before. The manager lied to me, saying there were no other rooms available, and had no explanation when I pointed to the front desk clerk, who confirmed what the Marriott website said about other rooms available. The room I was provided was the smallest room I have ever experienced...my home closet is larger! Worse yet, the room did not feel clean. The bathroom floor was unacceptable. Thankfully, I was able to check out the next day and find a much better hotel at about a third less. In sum, ridiculously small, unclean room with horrible management.Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are disappointed to hear that you had a less than perfect experience. We will pass along this review to each department to ensure that problems like yours do not occur again. Cheers!	1.0
Overall, the stay was good. The staff, however, was a mixed bag. Lady at front desk was friendly enough, but gave us the wrong times for breakfast (telling us that breakfast was served to 10:00 on Fridays when it really stopped at 9:00 my teenage daughters almost missed breakfast). Also, the woman who drives the early morning shuttle to the airport as well as served breakfast on Wednesday morning was extremely RUDE. Made snarky comments to customers in the breakfast room and left a poor family with small children on their way to the airport, telling them that there was no more room in the shuttle when there was plenty of room. (My family were the only people on the shuttle and we pointed out that there was plenty of room and we were fine with waiting while they loaded on, but she would not wait for them.) On the other hand, the nice brunette, younger woman who worked the breakfast room on Thursday through Saturday morning was super friendly and accommodating and even made extra eggs for my daughters on the morning that they almost missed breakfast.	4.0
Good location convenient to drives through the vineyard districts and excellent downtown restaurants. Relatively new, well maintained hotel with large, bright, attactive, spotless, comfortable rooms. We must praise the staff and are greatful for their good natured, spot-on advice. Shawn was on duty when we arrived. She gave us great advice for drives and restaurants (loved Ristorante Allegria) and she even went online to compile a list kid-friendly vineyards. We should also mention Shanirra who was on duty in the daytime. The breakfast included in the price of the room is served in the adjacent Denny's. Food was standard but service was a bit slow. To be fair, it was a very busy weekend. I do not hesitate to recommend this hotel to our friends and we will certainly stay there again. By the way, I think you can help hotels save money (and maybe get you a better price) by calling them direct rather than useing third party resellers. (like Priceline, Travelocity etc.)Thank you for your review. We strive to give the best customer service possible to make everyones experience enjoyable. Shawn and Shanirra are a great value to our staff and I am pleased they had the advise and information you needed. You are right either book direct or at Bestwestern.com for the best price. We will see you again the next time your in the area.	5.0

Very nice hotel! The employees were all very helpful, the rooms were very comfortable and clean, and everything in the rooms, the pool, and the lobby looked clean and up to date. The rates were really good and the location is the perfect driving distance from all the restaurants and stores. This hotel definitely aided in providing us with a positive Key West experience. The only negative thing that I have to say is about the the breakfast. There was no fruit! The only thing they had fruit wise were oranges. It would have been nice if they had fruits like bananas and apples paired up with those oranges. Other than that everything else was A plus.Dear natalianieves22,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel and providing your feedback. We are Happy that you had a Positive Key West Experience, and enjoyed your stay with us. Also thank you for letting me know about the Fruit. We do usually have Bananas as well as cut fruit on the buffet and I will be looking into it so it doesn't happen again. We hope to see you back in Key West again very soon.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager	4.0
The hotel was very clean and the room was comfortable. Off the main drag so there wasn't a lot of traffic noise. The only downfall is that there isn't a continental breakfast. They did have a cupboard where you could purchase food and other items which helped out.	5.0
Staff was very friendly and helpful. I couldn't ask for better service. The 24hr coffee/tea stations was wonderful (used it a lot)!

We are pleased that you enjoyed your stay and hope that you will return soon!	5.0
I was expecting a more welcoming attitude from the reception. Some of them were nice but there is one guy who was very serious and never smiled. I didn't understand if he had a bad time or this is simply his personality. The floor I stayed on had a little bit of unfresh air on the entrance. I stayed before and room condition was better. Also one time shuttle service took more than one hour to arrive for pickup. We waited from 3:30 pm to 4:40 pm we called at 3:20 pm but looks like they skipped one pick-up turn.	3.0
This hotel provided a stimulated experience with the abundance of local art on display. Pool was wonderful despite the shallow depth (4 feet). I was also amazed at how quiet it was given all of the negative review I read prior concerning noise levels. Hotel is immaculate, surrounded by nice eateries, coffee shops, and bars. Staff were friendly and accommodating. Overall, I had a great time. I like the new artsy vibe in downtown AZ. The only issues we experienced were 1) Bathroom sink kept clogging at night. 2) There are no hooks in the bathroom to hang towels (this we found quite annoying and odd).Thank you for taking the time to write a review. We're bummed we missed the mark in a couple of areas. Our engineering team has actually been going floor by floor to install the bathroom hooks over the past week and are still working on them. Hopefully, next time you visit you'll have them to use. As far as the bathroom sink, we will certainly have someone fix it!	4.0
The hotel staff is friendly and helpful and the rooms are clean. The location is horrible as there isn't anything close in the way of stores or restaurants. If you arrive late you will have extremely limited access for dinning except for the over priced microwave food at the front desk. Breakfast and cocktail hour are a nice touch, but both need to be extended by an hour.	3.0
Although clean, this hotel is in great need of renovation. Breakfast is the usual selections. Front desk was most helpful when we inquired about a local church and their times of services.

I don't want to be repetitive - but have no hesitation in staying at this hotel. It is a wonderful hotel, and the grounds are spectacular.

My Dad and I stayed here for two nights while visiting Atlanta for the Chick Fil-A kickoff game between Louisville and Auburn. It was good value for money, with a spacious and comfortable room that was in great shape. The bathroom was spotless and seemed new. Even on the fifth floor, the noise from breakfast diners begins at 7:00 AM and is rather loud in rooms near the atrium, so if you want more quiet, request a room further away.	4.0
We made plans last minute so we were worried if this place would be nice. We were very happy with our experience! We were 1 hour early for check-in but the staff said it was okay. Check in was quick and fast. We parked across the street at the garage. Rooms were clean, we had requested top floor which they accommodated! View was PERFECT! Exactly what we wanted! Rooms are a bit dated like the carpet and the bathroom but very clean and plenty of towels. Room had a flat screen TV which we never even turned on because there was so much to do! Free hot breakfast was great the next morning. The staff is EXCEPTIONAL! Very friendly, they always smile. Very efficient! Every time we needed something, they went out of their way to meet our needs. I will definitely visit again just because of the family friendly atmosphere and the super attentive staff!	4.0
Hotel was a fantastic location. The room was unique and we'll maintained. Enjoyed the blue light located throughout the property. Bed was conformable, however small. Good and happy vibe. 1 opportunity I would make for improvement is the timeliness for valet. Car retrival took well over 30 mintutes. I noticed their bell staff was not around and the lobby hardly have anyone in it. When you are paying 30+ for valet it should be rocket speed. Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed your time here and we hope you will come back and see us again. Parking and valet services can take some time because our parking lot is located six blocks off-site. We are happy that even though you experienced issues with this you still enjoyed your stay.	4.0

I stayed Monday through Friday on a business trip. When I checked in, I did a quick scan of the room, there was no refrigerator or microwave. I pulled the comforter back and noticed about 7 (what appeared to be) burn holes in the sheet, right by the pillow. I was moved to another room that had a small refrigerator and microwave. The room was dirty, cobwebs in the corner by the old A/C unit. The A/C was very loud and woke me up throughout the night when it would kick in. The chair in front of the unit was stained and not all the lights/fixtures were operational. The fitness area was a mess and the equipment was broken, cups on the floor, empty water container, and towels on the floor. Typical continental breakfast, sometimes there was coffee in the morning, but not every morning.	2.0

The Pier 5 Hotel is excellent for a quite romantic weekend. Once you check in, you have Ruth Chris or McCormick and Schmick's right off the hotel lobby. Within walking distance is the entire Baltimore waterfront district with nightclubs for just about everyone. The only downside was parking. While parking is available next to the hotel, the cost is 22.00 per pay and if you use valet parking, it 29.00 per day. You would think for the price they charge per night for a room, parking would be included.	5.0

The rooms are very comfortable, the breakfast punctual and delicious, the staff incredibly accommodating and courteous and the location central. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend it to any business travelers.	5.0
Stayed 1 night as an SPG Gold member through the Amex Platinum Fine Hotels Resorts program. The hard product at the property is good but let down by extraordinarily bad service - hands down the worst received at any 5* luxury hotel.- On reserving, the hotel insisted that as a couple with a young child, we must book a rollaway bed at an extra charge and we could not share one king bed for health and safety reasons. Accepting the higher rate charge, on arrival, there was no rollaway provided. Luckily we didn't want one but they were extremely insistent on this fact when booking.- No welcome amenity offered as SPG Gold member.- Check-in experience went from cold and marginally polite to confrontational. Hotel would not honor the contractual one-category if available upgrade of the Amex FHR program. The hotel's own website defines these room categories for sale: superior, deluxe, grand luxe rooms, then 1 bedroom suites. Within the 1 bedroom suite category, the room types are Astor, Deluxe, Madison. Having booked a grand luxe room, at checkin their website showed availability for Deluxe and Madison suites. The agent insisted their obligation was only a one-room type upgrade, and not a category upgrade (which means any room type in that category). Therefore as no Astor suite was available, no upgrade for us.- I spoke to the Front Desk Manager, Susan, who insisted their interpretation of the FHR contract was correct. Having now spent 20 mins waiting for them to check round the back as they put it, with nowhere offered for my family to sit, I just wanted to get to a room. I then called Amex, who contacted the hotel. Unfortunately by this point Susan had allocated the available Deluxe suites to other guests or at least blocked them, and lied to my Amex agent claiming that I had been seeking an upgrade to a Madison suite worth 1000 extra, and the contract prohibits a triple room type upgrade. I don't appreciate the hotel manipulating their inventory, nor lying to my Amex agent when my request was for a Deluxe suite allowable by the FHR contract and worth only approx 200-300 more. Amex advise the hotel clearly has different definitions of available and category and these do not equate to available for sale on their website and category of room as listed on their website - sounds like they are happy to use different definitions to deny loyalty benefits.- On being shown to our room, the agent advised a butler would introduce himself in a couple of minutes. One hour later, no butler. I page the butler and receive a call back, requesting a champagne ice bucket and child amenities (these weren't provided even though child was listed on the reservation). Another hour later, still no sign of anything. Page the butler again, received the amenities... never received the requested ice bucket. Last we ever saw of the butler. No offer of many of the complimentary services as advertised on their website, but nice of them to provide tea cookies/milk.- Ordered room service dinner (with the still missing ice bucket) - quality was very average for the price and beware families, this hotel charges an 8 per PERSON room service charge which I have never encountered at any other hotel. So a family of 3 would pay a whopping 24 in addition to mandatory 20 gratuity and sales tax. The waiter advised us just to lie and say we are just one person next time! Called for the trays/trolley to be collected, 90mins later nobody had come and it was collected by housekeeping at turndown.- Tried to organise family activities through the concierge as advertised on their website, they acknowledged our request but never heard back from them after that. - Advertised functionality to stream your iPad media to the hotel TV does not work.- Included complimentary breakfast worth 41 is the most basic continental breakfast ever seen, consisting solely of 4 pastries, coffee and one orange juice. - On checkout, the agent's only words from walking to the desk were Mr , here is your bill, let me correct this error, hope to see you again. No how was your stay or anything similar.When paying four figures to stay in a hotel room, this doesn't meet any expectations and this stay was our first and last at a St Regis.Dear msnz,Please allow us to thank you for posting your review on Trip Advisor. We understand that our Director of Rooms has connected with you privately and we hope you are satisfied with the resolution. We hope to be at your service again soon and, until then, please contact our executive office for any additional assistance you may need.Kind Regards,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager	1.0

We had a great stay at the Ritz in Pentagon City however it was not without a few faults. First on our first night we attempted to order room service which was supposed to be available 24/7 however after letting the phone ring for over five minutes without any one answering.... Twice we tried calling the concierge and got the same lack of response so we gave up and went to bed hungry. The other issue was with the shower. The water pressure from the bath tub faucet was fine and the water was hot but on e you switched it to shower there was so little flow that it would take forever to rinse shampoo out of your hair. I eventually resorted to switching back to the bathtub faucet and used one of the glasses to rinse my hair filing it from the bathtub faucet. The next night I decided I would just take a bath instead of standing in the sprinkle of the shower however the bathtub stopper would not deal off enough to even get more than 1 inch of water in the tub. To get by I used that came glass to cover the drain and it worked well enough after I wrapped a wash cloth around the base to help seal it off. I know these seem like small first world problems, but when you are staying at the Ritz there is a certain expectation of quality	3.0
Got off to a rocky start, but after I was able to make the staff aware of my concerns my stay was FANTASTIC. I will Definitely make this my location of choice when I am in the DC area. I would also like to state there is no one staff member that I can commend over anther. I have been in the service industry for 25 years and it takes a lot to impress me I am impressed!	5.0

You can walk to Arlington Cemetary the Iwo Jima Memorial from the hotel, as well as to a supermarket restaurants. The hotel shuttle was very reliable, running in the morning afternoon Mon-Fri to from the Metro station once a day to the supermarket. The suites were large, with a pull-out sofa in every room. It wasn't the most comfortable, but it was great to have a separate bedroom area full kitchen. The only thing I was suprised at was the fact that we had to lift our heavy luggage up about 5 steps to get to the elevators. There were no ramps. From the parking lot, it's a straight shot through the front doors of the main entrance. I saw some people arrive by bus, which dropped them off on a side street. They were dragging their luggage up about 30 stairs to get to the parking lot! Instead, they could've just walked around along the street in front of the hotel to get to the lot. Going up all those stairs with luggage did not look fun!	4.0
I have stayed at this property each time I visit family in New Jersey. Always very nice with super clean rooms, friendly staff and a great restaurant. Easy to get to and affordable.

We stayed at the Ritz for 5 nights in a club levelSuite. Location was wonderful, right by Boston Common and multiple T stops. Service was wonderful, especially from the concierge, front desk and club lounge staff. Staff made my 4 young children feel special and they enjoyed the scavenger hunt and little toys provided. The room was lovely and well appointed though a little smaller than it appeared in the website. I would definitely stay here again when I Boston! In fact Im planning on a business trip to Cambridge soon and considering staying here and commuting.Dear mnmorange,So glad to hear you enjoyed your recent stay with your family at The Ritz-Carlton, Boston, with all of the city so easily accessible just outside our doors. It is wonderful to know that you and your children were well taken care of by the friendly and professional ladies and gentlemen throughout the hotel. Thank you for taking the time to comment on your visit. We hope you will return for that upcoming business trip - getting to Cambridge from the hotel is a breeze - as well as many more occasions, when it will be our sincere pleasure to welcome you back.Warmest regards,William P.

Very close to the Space Needle, EMP Museum and Duck Tour ride. Our room was close to the Monorail track but there was not much of disturbance. Walking distance to all attractions or you can take the Mono rail to down town locations. Very good breakfast. Rooms were very good with a small kitchen.SriGa,Thank you for staying with us next to the Space Needle! We love our incredible location and are ecstatic that you felt the same way.

stayed for a birthday party on the 26th DEC. SAL at the front desk was amazing!!!!! he is so sweet and his service was completely very welcoming. Anything we needed or had questions about SAL was the guy to go to. he knew all the area asked what we liked and made sure our car was there without waiting. All others at the front desk were not as professional and were not courteous. there was a big difference in service. SAL made it feel like we were in Vegas very professional. I will be coming back again ONLY if SAL is there. ME and my Husband luv the place. Thank you SAL!!!!	5.0

For the price, definitely worth it. And, other than the Petit Jean lodge and cabins (which probably have to be booked WAY in advance), it's the only place convenient to the park, so for that reason alone, I would stay there again, for sure.	4.0

I wish tripadvisor had 1/2 stars for our use because I would have given this a 2 1/2...3 is too high. This was our first hotel of 8 different ones on our Napa/Pacific Coast vacation, so I have a lot to compare it to. I have many other reviews on this site and I try to be fair when reviewing any property we've sayed at.Having said that.....It was my first experience at a Best Western brand and if this is a plus property I would not want to stay at a non-plus one.I disagree with the person responding to all of the other reviews...this is not a good value or comparable value to other hotels in the area. Who are you comparing yourself with When comparing properties you need to look at the amenities of hotels in your price range. You are priced as high as other properties but those properties have better/more amenities or are closer to vineyards, therefore it's not a fair comparison. It's like comparing apples and oranges...both fruits but there are many different qualities. Now back to the property....Don't expect to see any vines even though the word is in the name. This is located on a very busy road surrounded by stores and restaurants. If that's what you're looking for, great book it, just be aware that there will be a lot of traffic noise and light polution.Cons....The pool's capacity is 8 people. That should tell you something about the size. I'd guess it's 8X10' (that's probably a generous estimate). In my opinion putting in a couple of extra hottubs instead of the tiny pool would have been more beneficial. The balcony we had was so closed in and dark. The solid front and sides don't allow you to see anything when sitting in the chairs, not that the view was great....we looked out over Denny's roof and a traffic light. Oh, Dennys. sigh.....went our first 2 mornings. Ordered the free entree of 2 eggs, 2 pancakes and 2 bacon or sausage. Getting a hot entree I guess is impossible, the food was cold to the touch. My husband faced the kitchen and saw the breakfasts sitting up on the counter for a long period of time before the waitress bothered to serve it. There were maybe 4 other parties in the restaurant at the time, not busy at all. The tea water was luke warm at best. Total waste of my time.Location...not your romantic getaway place by any means. About 20 to 25 minutes to the heart of Napa's wine country depending on traffic. In hinesight I would not have booked this hotel if not for the MANY( now suspicious in my mind)...reviews. I find it hard to believe that this many people think this hotel is the best. Really After spending 3 days in Napa and seeing many other hotels closer to the wineries, I question the validity of these raving reviews.Pros....Yes there are a few...I promised a fair review and that's what I deliver.Shower....best shower head of any hotel. In fact I'm looking for one for my own shower.Cleanliness....our room was very clean. Small in size in comparison to other hotels on our trip and just an armoire instead of a closet. Microwave, fridge and coffee pot was a nice convenience.Bed/pillows....very comfortable.So if you're looking for a clean place to sleep that's a bit overpriced than book this hotel. If you want to see vineyards from your balcony and sit by a nice pool...don't book this property. At most I would expect to pay under 100 a night for this property based on it's location and lack of amenities. All the renovations in the world don't matter to me if they're not available when I'm there. They need to charge accordingly.We paid 537 for Saturday, Sunday and Monday evenings. I now know we could have spent the same money and stayed at a better property. Oh well, live and learn.Thank you for your detailed review. First, we do compare our hotel to our competition by actually going to all the hotels in our class and looking at their rooms and overall condition of their property. Each hotel will have their pluses and minuses. We also shop prices on a daily basis and we make sure we are competitive in our market. We actually have all the prices of the hotels on the days you stayed and only one hotel was less than our price and its located 9 miles south of Napa, further away from the vineyards. On average you would have paid between 75 -200 more for your stay in a comparable hotel.All Best Westerns that have at least a 3 diamond recognition from AAA have the opportunity to be a PLUS property as long as they have a PIP( property Improvement Plan) in place. With the cost that runs in the hundreds of thousands of dollars it will take time for each property to complete. There is a time frame on completing this and we are well ahead of the deadlines. Our rates are similar to last years (before Plus) and we have added breakfast at Dennys and many more amenities. We never hide the fact that we have a small pool (12x 184). There are pool area pictures displayed on our website and other 3rd party sites. When a guest inquires about the pool we let them know that we have a small pool. We recommend other hotels if a guest are looking for a larger pool.As for reviews, all reviews are honest and we know that there will be a difference of opinions and as you can see we are rated in the middle of the hotels in Napa. We are a family run hotel and take pride in our hotel and are always looking at ways to improve. TripAdvisor is way too smart to let suspicious reviews slip through as it is their reputation and ours.Thank you for your compliments on the cleanliness of our rooms, (we are an ultra clean property) our shower heads and beds. The shower heads are by Delta and Ive actually seen them at Home Depot. The bed that was in your room is a Cheshire IV pillow top by Serta. Thank you again for your review.	2.0
Great location a block off canal and just outside French quarter, very nice rooms, spacious, not much privacy in bathroom space and somewhat see through shower glass pane into main room. Would be more ideal for couples then friends/family. Overall great atmosphere. Very happy, would book again.Thank you for taking the time to share your review of our hotel. We do have a bit of flare in the most of the bathrooms as you alluded but we certainly have rooms with a bit more modesty available, please be sure to note and request that when you book next time!See you soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations	4.0

This hotel is a Club Quarters hotel, which means that it is geared towards business travelers. Our room was small, but perfectly adequate since we weren't in Chicago to spend time in our hotel room. The hotel reminded me of a European hotel, especially since it's in an old building. The location is perfect right across the street from the River, near Michigan Ave. between the Magnificent Mile and the Loop. The hotel restaurant is surprisingly good, and makes the famous Chicago deep dish pizza. The couple at the table next to us were staying at the Fairmont and their concierge recommended it.	4.0

A standard not fancy hotel that provides a little privacy and extra space at a good rate if you want an affordable suite. Decent pretty big breakfast buffet (could someone figure out that 15 of us don't digest dairy and really like having something like soy or almond milk). little pool only good for kids. Nice big lobby and lounge areas.Jesse L,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

Service is always impeccable there, everyone you meet with goes out of their way for you. The rooms facing the ocean are just awesome, wake up to the 18th green of Pebble with the ocean behind it, and the sun rising over the mountains in the background. Never gets old.

The hotel staff is fantastic. From the front desk to the pools to restaurants, everyone is pleasant, helpful and anxious to be of service. Biggest downside would be the location. It's 30-40 minutes from the nearest good restaurants and after 3 days the in-house restaurants get kind of old. It's a far cheaper option than Four Seasons Scottsdale and offers... More	4.0
Amazing and wonderful! Clean!! Susan, at the front desk, went above and beyond to give us great accommodations on very short notice! We will be back! I Highly recommend! This is an updated hotel that gives a very good first impression when you walk in the door. The rooms don't disappoint. Very affordable too!	5.0
The bathroom was too cramped the room just average. The menus were overpriced and unremarkable. The staff was courteous and responsive to requests. The fitness facility was adequate however, the lap pool is too short and too hot. The locker rooms were exceptional. The access to the Fashion Centre was an unexpected treat.	4.0
Rooms spacious, including bathroom. Clean and functioning well. Attentive staff. Very dated decor throughout - distracting, but little impact on our experience there. Requested 2 queen as listed on Hotels.com, but hotel offers 2 DOUBLE beds, which is a significant drawback for our family. Free ear plugs because closing doors are LOUD. That might have been the only downside. Pool and hottub were great. Ample supply of towels with extended access hours as compared to some places we've stayed. Breakfast was good, but crowded. Layout is a challenge when busy as several key items are in corners or nooks. No place to line up but through the dining tables, pathway, etc. Would stay here again if the price were right. Otherwise, would be a more modern competitor with queen beds.	4.0
Bad: access to parking. Good: the location	4.0
While in St. Louis for a medical visit, selected this Hampton Inn due to close proximity to Barnes Medical. Was upgraded to a suite at check-in.

Breakfast was good and the eating area... More	5.0
Bad: The room lacked a traditional desk and desk chair. This made it uncomfortable to use a computer. Good: Breakfast served on each floor	4.0
Bad: Hotel restaurant was good but a bit pricey. Good: Very good value, located across from the beach but several blocks south of the chaos and noise. If arriving by auto, be aware that parking in MB is a problem. Private lots charge 30-40/day. I suggest parking in municipal garages within walking distance for half the cost.	5.0
This has a really nice swimming pool. A good breakfast, and you can dine beside the pool, and it's right beside a mall and there is a shuttle right to the cruise port.

Got off to a rocky start as the room was not ready at our check in time, guaranteed late check in. This was at 10pm on a Sunday night! The lobby was full of customers who could not check in also, at least 7 different reservations where being held up. Front desk staff had to leave check the rooms to see if they had been cleaned at 10:30! Thankful, my room was ready by then, not sure how the others made out as I wasn't sticking around to hear the complaints. The breakfast consist of powered scrambled eggs, powered egg cheese omelette, under or over cooked bacon, link or patty sausage (only one meat a day, fruit that was not fresh, and broken waffle, coffee, other machines during the week. It's food with zero taste. One of the two elevators has been out of service for the entire 8 days I have been here. The maids did do a good job cleaning the room every day. The picture on the website for the pool is a straight out lie yes, it has a pool, and no, it is only a average to small pool in size. More than 15 guest at any times makes it a little jammed. Overall, it's a room a bed.	3.0
Bad: poor room comfort no room for clothes very old bath accesories high price.	4.0
This hotel was good in all respects. The only complaint I can think of was the heating system in the room was a little too noisy. The staff is extremely courteous and helpful. The breakfast was great, and the room was very comfortable. No complaints other than the one I first mentioned. You will like staying here.	5.0
We were a famaily of 4. Great hotel. The lobby and the room were top class. Almost like a luxury hotel. Breakfast was included in the price. Excellent breakfast. Very happy to choose this one. Will come back next time.	5.0
Great location (downtown, access to bus and Metro, shops, restaurants), Very good and friendly service, general comfort, I did benefit from a special price offer due to low attendance i guess.A few little things to be improved to me are the waiting time (up or down) at the elevator - one elevator only for the upper floors - Insulation in the room (Air, street noise) could be better too. But overall a good experience.	4.0

Room was clean, breakfast was OK and the desk clerks were friendly. Now for the bad: My daughter tried putting brown sugar on her oatmeal and it was solid like a rock in the shaker.The juice machine was covered with fruit flies and the lady tending to the food was rude when we accidentally dropped some food on the floor stating she would be the one cleaning it up later. The 3rd floor hall was like an ice box due to remodeling. The heater in the room did not work properly. The pool was closed for renovations.The vending machine was almost completely out of food. Thanks for a horrible experience. It will be a cold day in Hades before Holiday Inn gets my hard earned money again.	1.0
This hotel was awful. It was so noisy you could hear EVERYTHING. Lots and lots and lots of kids running and screaming the entire night. Guess it might be good for a family but unless you have wild children it is not worth it. I heard every car outside. One of our pillows had dirt on it. We booked a king bed and got two queens. It smelled weird. It was dated. An elevator was out so it always took forever to go up or down. The parking was cramped and limited. Save your money and don't waste it on this place.I have stayed at nicer Motel 6's.	2.0
There City of Baltimore was having a water problem because of the extreme cold temps. The desk staff did not tell us at checkin that we may have a water problem in the room. We first found out about this not having water in the toilet, That was eventually rectified but we did not have any hot water. After unloading a family ( 6 and 3 year old) in the desk staff told us to go to dinner and there SHOULD be hot water when we return, No t want to risk that option we ask for a refund and that we woudl be leaving. The desk staff was reluctant at first to give the refund but when I insisted because they could not guarantee hot water they finally did. They failed to understand that a hot water issue was a hotel problem not a City of Baltimore.	2.0

Good: Delightfully smoke free! No casino, so much quieter than regular Las Vegas hotels. Just behind The Flamingo, so short walk to monorail, Paris or the strip. The concierge, Spencer, was very helpful in getting back to the motel quickly after our show.	5.0

We stayed there for our honeymoon and it was such a great experience.

We evacuated to this hotel ahead of Hurrican Irma from Florida. The staff couldn't have been nicer or friendlier. Decor not much, but decent size room. The 4-star rating is for the staff and extra's. They have nice amenities--indoor/outdoor pool, small fitness room, but very nice and accommodating hot breakfast (free) AND free Happy Hour with 3 drinks each AND hot and cold appetizer buffet, which was enough to eat as dinner. There was nice green, tossed ( fresh) salad, soup, chili, hot dog bar, nacho bar, Italian pasta, chicken fingers, cheese, fruit, and one to two other items I do not remember. What I ate was good--did not try chicken fingers. Thought it was a nice extra for what you would normally pay for a hotel.	4.0

There was an old, musty smell in the room and the internet did not work. we could only pick up wifi in the hallway. These two components alone are enough to put this hotel at the bottom of my list, but what tops it off is the poor service. The front desk staff does the bare minimum to accommodate guests. It is apparent that they do not care about whether or not we have an enjoyable stay. At check in, we had a question about why our room did not have a microfridge and wanted to know what it would take to get one. The clerk that we initially spoke to was rude and gave us information that the supervisor later informed us was incorrect. The following day we went for breakfast after a morning meeting-- we got there at 930 and it ends at 930, but everything was still set up and the man at the desk was preparing waffles for himself. We went to make waffles as well and he informed us that there was no more mix and because it was 930 they would not restock. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with that policy, but having just watched him fix himself a big plate literally 30seconds earlier, it felt incredibly inconsiderate and cold. Ultimately, if you need to stay here because it is the best option for your paycheck, it may work for you, but do not expect too much in regards to customer service. On the other hand, if you can afford the extra 10-15 dollars it may cost to stay somewhere else, do yourself a favor an stay elsewhere. I am will not return to this hotel.	2.0
Good: The AC hotel was perfect for what we needed. We were a group of friends coming from different states to meet up. It was conveniently located close to public transportation and made it easy for all of us to get there. The hotel was in a great location! It's close to Michigan Avenue/ Water Tower Mall and Navy Pier.	5.0
We needed a room last minute and this resort was reasonably priced. Was hesitant because it's so kid-centric, but they won me over.

I stayed here with my mother and niece. Upon arrival, I found a USED CONDOM on the floor. I went to the front desk who told me they were sorry in a non apologetic tone, but did not offer me a new room nor to come pick it up or any money off my hotel room. The room was dirty, the bed was very uncomfortable. In the morning when I went to check out I waited for the woman to get off the phone before a rude man busted in front of me and asked to be checked out. The woman at the front desk did not tell him I was next in line and she SERVED him FIRST despite me waiting there. I will never go back here nor will I reccomend it. It's disgusting.	1.0
Amazing red rock views -- especially at sunset! Right in the heart of downtown Sedona -- everything is within walking distance! They also have condos that will accommodate families.

We staid at this hotel for two nights. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is great! The Lincoln Park Zoo is 5 minutes walk away, there are multiple bars and restaurants in walking distance and even downtown (Millenium Park) is walkable (about 2 hours walk if you walk slowly and look at all the other fun buildings around). The only negative about the hotel would be bathroom. It was clean but old and in need of an upgrade. We would stay here again if we come back to Chicago.	4.0

This hotel is conveniently located off 1-10 but for the price we were a bit disappointed. The carpet in the hallway on our floor was very wrinkled, needs to be restretched or replaced and we had a lot of trouble getting our door open as the keylock was rickety and had a sort of personality of its own you had to lean on the door at the same time as putting the keycard in the slot. There was a lot of noise from someone in the room above us, walking or jumping on the floor which of course was our ceiling. It went on for a long time and made it so my mom couldn't sleep so I called the front desk to complain. The front desk clerk must have called them so it stopped for a good while, happened again briefly and then stopped for the night. The breakfast was good, pretty standard for La Quinta and I liked that they had Mexican salsa, fried potatoes and good sized disposable paper coffee cups. I don't like the weird industrial type scrambled eggs at this and other La Quintas because they don't even seem like real eggs at all, more like some liquid egg heated in a microwave. They have little flavor and the texture leaves a lot to be desired. Wish they were real, freshly cooked eggs and that someone in top management at La Quinta headquarters would pay attention and improve that. That would definitely improve my opinion of their breakfasts!Dear Traveler,Thank you for choosing our property for your traveling needs. We are working on plans to renovate the hotel this year. It is our hope you will come back and see us again. Sincerely, Vickie W.	3.0

Due to an unexpected ice storm in Maine, we needed to leave a day early. Not only did this hotel take us in a day early, they let us into the room at 10 instead of 3!

The hotel is located close to Walmart, many nice eateries, shopping. 15 min from Newark, an hour or so from Virginia Beach and 5 min from the Coast Guard Base.

Bad: The hotel room did not meet expectations. There was shaved hair in the shower (did not belong to us) and the water did not get hot. It took 10 minutes of running the water to even get to a somewhat comfortable temperature. It was requested for our two rooms to be beside each other and that request was unable to be met. Finally, when my child got sick with the flu, they were unwilling to work with me on the two nights I paid for and lost because she was sick. Good: Location and pool	2.0

Bad: We were not entirely satisfied with the buffet breakfast at the restaurant. The Westin should maybe think about adding a ommlett station, and a waffle station. Good: Rooms are great! Amenities are great! Location 1 block off the strip is great as you can escape from the hustle and bustle for a break to relax. Having 24hr access to pool and hot tub was also great! As relaxing and winding down in the hot tub at the end of your night or day is a real treat!	5.0
The hotel is decent but lacks pizazz. Its kind of stuck in the 70's. However its still clean, functional, and a budget friendly place to lay your head for a night or two. Dont expect a lot for what your paying. Your not going to pay much so your not going to get much.	2.0

We arrived at the hotel feeling positive about the location and warm-ish greeting at reception. This feeling did not last long. The pillows were really uncomfortable, both of the taps were hot, the AC was so loud and made a buzzing noise (we asked twice to have this fixed and nothing changed), the fire alarm went off at 3am and there was never really an excuse given as to what was going on, then (because we'd had no sleep) we put the 'do not disturb' sign on and the cleaner banged on our door repeatedly shouting 'housekeeping' until we answered. The water was shut off one evening from 11pm-3am which meant that when we had to go to the toilet it sat there for hours. No one informed us where a smoking area was so we assumed there was not one... this meant that we smoked out the front and got disturbed, bugged and pushed by homeless people asking for money, cigerettes, etc. It really was just one thing after the other. The cups were so rubbish that they leaked, my oartner hit his head on the shower because of a stupid bar across the top and they charged 50 dollars a night for a hold This was not really made clear at the beginning and I was left wondering why I was missing so much from my account. I have stayed in many hotels, hostels, bnbs over the years and had just stayed in 4 other places, all were LESS money and gave a better, quality experience.	2.0
Bad: Why didn't I know about Kinzie West That is what you show in your ads, but I got only the highest floor of the Unwest Kinzie. I was expecting a better view of the city.	4.0
Bad: Hotel was under a major renovation n there is no casino n no restaurants within the hotel. Ice machine was broken on our floor. You have to have key access to get ice from other floors but no access ever given. We had to ask 6 times for keys! They wouldn't work at all! Very very inconvenient! Apparently from what the staff said they have key problems all the time n i saw lots of guest going through the same problems. Staff is also rude in a professional way. Good: Beds we're comfy	3.0
The 2 room suite was great and the overall service was outstanding. The price of the suite was very reasonable. The provided Breakfast was great and the front desk personnel were outstanding. We could not have asked for better service. We will stay there on all of our trips to Phoenix.	5.0
Nice suite with 2 bedrooms fold out couch- was great to have 3 separate places to sleep, for 3 guys in town for LA Angels vs Red Sox baseball game.. Great ideal location for ballpark access- w/ parking included easy walk to ball field. Great breakfast. Best value for suite of any hotel i stayed in over my week in California. All rooms in suite were clean nice. (Would also be good for family going to nearby disneyland)We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim.

We picked this place to stay based on other reviews. I must say I have mixed feelings about this place.

I stayed one night at this beautiful building in Back Bay. Unfortunately, my particular room had a very uncomfortable bed that was not level. I believe the problem was the mattress itself just being old, not the bed frame. I had to put a book between the mattress and the box spring to level it a bit. Additionally, the room was extremely hot, owing to the radiator being left on while the room was empty. I recommend that the hotel consider keeping the heat off between guests. Otherwise, the facility was great. The public areas are beautiful and the staff were very friendly and helpful.	4.0
complimentary breakfast, kitchen facility, close to speedways.	4.0
I stayed here on a business trip. The hotel is very clean, modern, odor and scent-free and well-decorated. The room was well-appointed. The shower was a bit weak. The heater was quiet. The exercise room was merely adequate but very clean. Valet parking is 18 daily.	4.0

I recently stayed at the Hyatt House Hotel in Seattle, it was a great place to stay. Our room was very nice and clean, the staff were helpful and friendly, and our view out of the window was of the space needle. The hotel is in a great location with a 2 minute ride on the monorail into Seattle town. Plenty of restaurants and coffee shops and Pike Place Market to wander around.	5.0
We had a 15 night stay and this was perfect. There was great restaurants nearby and the kitchenette is great to make things in your room and save on meals. The staff was very accomodating and supported any requests that we made. PArticularly when we needed an extra night and they were oversold. Aric was a gem constantly checking on how we were doing when he saw us on the property and assisting with some printing needs when the lobby printer was tied up and I needed to get some things mailed ASAP. I definately recommend this hotel if you are going to Disney or looking to attend an Angels game.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you so much for your wonderful review. I am so glad to hear that we were able to accommodate you and your family.Hope to see you again on your next trip to Anaheim.Hospitably,Greg WilliamsGeneral Manager	5.0

I very much enjoyed my stay. The room was excellent and the location perfect for my business trip. It turned out to be very near many tourist attractions as well. I give special kudos to the staff - I left a shirt in the room as I was trying to make a hasty exit to get to a meeting and the staff was wonderful about getting the shirt and shipping it back to me. All in all, a wonderful stay!	5.0
Me and my husband use this hotel for date night several times a year. It's clean and the staff is super friendly. The breakfast is good and it's quiet. The price is ok could be better but you get what you pay for	5.0
Staff was very nice and helpful, room was clean...............	5.0
This is a decent motel The staff is very friendly the breakfast is quite sparse compared to some other places at similar prices. Since there is no place to eat it they don't mind you taking something back to the room which I recommend over standing there at the front desk. All motels in Sunnyvale are expensive compared to similar places elsewhere so we have to factor that in to the price. I have stayed twice recently. All the rooms are not equal. The first one on second floor was a bit nicer because of the layout. The one downstairs in the back was more convenient for luggage, but the room layout was weird and not as comfortable. The immediate location is not great in terms of walking (there is only a Denny's next door), but its 5 minutes from downtown if you have a car.	3.0
This is the 2nd time staying at the hotel. Very convenient to a club we go to for concerts. There are a number of good eating places nearby. A little confusing to get to if you are not familiar with the area. For some reason, there was only one bath towel in the room when we checked in, but they were able to get us a 2nd set shortly after we notified them. Also, the shower may have been hooked up incorrectly because H meant cold and C meant hot in our case. The breakfast is very good. Overall, we would stay there again good rates, friendly front desk, and the breakfast are all reasons to come back.	4.0
The air conditioner in my room was very noisy, kept me up, had to trun it off and open windows. That let in the light and street noise (which was quieter than air condioner). Bathtub drain plug was broken so I had to tak a shower whch I don't like to do. No shampoo or conditioner.	3.0
We arrived at the hotel a few days after a devastating thunderstorm had knocked out power to a large portion of DC, MD, VA. The hotel had opened up to refugees that had no power so they did not have a room with 2 double beds as we had ordered. They gave us a room with a king bed and a rollaway bed. It was cramped for 4 of us. But the hotel staff was indeed marvelous and went out of their way to make our stay at DC a very good experience. Excellent location with metro and a great shopping mall on site. Lots of fabulous restaurants within a short walk. My kids loved the hotel and their indoor pool. We will stay there again the next time we visit DC.	5.0
The staff was helpful in locating where we were attending a meeting. The hotel was wonderful from the coffee and rookies to the facility. the indoor pool was great. The room was great and clean.

We loved the hotel. We came for the Kansas City Marathon, and found the hotel centrally located for everything. We had no reason to even get into our car to go out, except for our friends wanted to go to a restaurant that was not near by. Had we chosen what restaurant we would have just stayed at the hotel and ate there. We did the Link, and went to the Crown Shopping Center it was pretty awesome. We also walked through Washington Park to go to Union Station. It was a beautiful hotel, and we loved the view from our room on the 38th floor. We also loved the hotel was so close to the Marathon event. We definitely will return, and stay at this hotel again.	4.0
When i called to make a reservation they told me they have truck parking next door at a burger king.

I was not surprised by the excellent service and individual attention which was given to me other wedding guests that stayed at this lovely property. Marriott is know for its' excellent service and attention to detail regarding its guests. The accommodations are always immaculately maintained, the front desk staff is always willing to assist regarding any reasonable request. I am a travel concierge, because of their stalwart commitment to service, I will continue to recommend the Courtyard by Marriott to my clients. Lisa and Jean welcomed me and additional family members and ensured that we were well informed regarding shopping opportunities close by. We were availed of their free shuttle services within a 3 mile radius throughout our stay. Friends and family were all there to attend my daughter's wedding just a few miles away, their individual attention to each party member made my stay at Salt River especially exceptional. While the entire hotel staff was amazing, I can't begin to bestow the appropriate amount of gratitude and praise Lisa and Jean deserve for their unrivaled professionalism and basic kindness...Well Done!!!	5.0

Bad: Problems with door lock led to no response from maintenance and even after security got us in, they failed to fix the lock (had to be recoded) despite assuring us they fixed it.

This was the second time I had stayed in this hotel. The first time I stayed it was still under the Southern Cross Hotel management group. I chose this hotel the first time due to its location, but after staying noticed it could have used some updating however the location made up for that. Well now that The Saint has rebranded this hotel it is truly the best value in Key West with top notch amenities along with the awesome location.On this trip we stayed with family and friends and this hotel meet our needs perfectly. I do think this hotel is also great for a more romantic getaway. It definitely has that modern romantic feel, but also suit family's as well. Very well done.The staff is among the nicest we have encountered in Key West and they really go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your stay. We will definitely be staying here in the future and I highly recommend you give this hotel a shot on your next trip to Key West. You won't be disappointed.Thank you for letting us know how much you enjoyed your recent stay at The Saint Hotel! We appreciate your positive comments on our staff and hotel atmosphere.

Overall great stay, rooms are small but cozy ... great fire place near bar to sit and drink wine. Staff was good except this one lady (I may go to extent of calling her border line racist), the reason: we were travelling to Lake Tahoe and asked hotel staff that can we leave our extra luggage at our check out and pick it up once we are back, we were told yes we can but on the day we were leaving she told us they will not, we told her that you guys said you can ... so what has changed to that she did not have any answer.

The room was decent as far as cleanliness, however, the room was very small with two beds and there was no closet or rack to hang up your clothing. It was ok, since we were there to attend a concert and shop at outlet, so the room served the purpose.

I've been taking my wife here for her birthday for the past 5 years. We stay either 5 or 6 days. Great location, great service. The desk staff are always helpful. Usually we get to take the Bentley for a ride to the Frick or another museum. That's a special treat for me. Last year they put us in a temporary room so we could take a nap until our reserved room was ready, then they upgraded us to a suite which was OMG. I couldn't believe how nice they were. We start every morning with the butler service coffee and something my wife packs for us. We are already looking forward to our stay in December 2016 and we just got tickets to The Comet to complement our stay. Oh, I forgot to mention it's an easy walk to Broadway and 5th Avenue shopping. I tried booking for December 2017 but it's still too early but I will book as soon as they let me.Dear ms2020, We were delighted to have you stay with us at The St. Regis New York and are thrilled to hear that you had an enjoyable experience.We aim to offer our guests a chic home away from home while they sojourn in the city and are delighted to have had you at the property!Thank you for taking the time to review the hotel on TripAdvisor, and we will see you in December!Please contact me directly at octavia.margineanstregis.com and I might be able to arrange your 2017 trip as well.

We spent 3 days at this hotel, whilst at a convention at the Anaheim Convention Center and at Disneyland. Although this is not the closest hotel property to either, it is the best as far as hospitality and professionalism go. We arrived a bit before the posted check in and before too long, we were able to go to our room. I have to say the visit to the Towneplace Suites, Anaheim was made exceptional by the staff that works there, notably Adilene at the front desk. The smiling and professional service that she provided is what one would expect at a Ritz Carlton or St. Regis property. Note to management: You should hold on to and value employees like Adilene.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your 5 star review. I am glad to hear that Adi and our team were able to give you 5 star service during your visit to Anaheim.I hope to see you on our next Disneyland Adventure!

This hotel was a really good selection for our late night flight arrival before a transatlantic cruise beginning the next day. Warm welcome, room was perfect, and rapid confirmation onto the separate cruise port shuttle the next day. Although extremely crowded, the staff was wonderful and handled the large volume of guests expertly. Morning free breakfast was quite good and... More	4.0
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at XV Beacon. All of the staff was friendly and attentive. The location is perfect for exploring Boston and for anywhere a little further, a driving service is offered. The driver, Mark, was very friendly and made sure to point out notable sites along the drive. The rate is expensive, but we enjoyed the high-level of service with multiple tidy services offered each day. The room was very comfortable for us.	5.0
We liked the garden feeling of the one story rooms in the back near the pool. Very lovely and quiet. Nice big trees around. Also, there was a lot of counter space in the bathroom which was handy. We thought of staying somewhere that cost less, read reviews and decided to go ahead and stay here instead. Good idea. You... More	5.0
As a lifetime Diamond member, I have stayed at many Hilton Properties. Several within New Orleans. The decor is contemporary and colorful. Rooms are spacious and well kept. The best part of my stay was the staff. Carl was especially helpful and made our stay easier. i will definitely be back.Thank you for taking the time to write this excellent review and for choosing our hotel as your place to stay during this recent trip to New Orleans. It sounds like our property and service provided exceeded all expectations which is our ultimate goal with all of our guests.

First, the bad -- pretty-much everything in the immediate area is shut down, other than the truck stop across the Interstate. Does that matter Not really, if you're looking for the four essential S functions of travel -- sleep, shower, shave and, well, you know the other one. I didn't detect any of the signs of sketchy activity in the... More	4.0
I stayed last year and room was great. This year - complete opposite. The mattress was bad, the sofa was stain with who knows what!!! It was just a filthy disappointment - as I highly recommended this hotel based on my experience the prior year. I WILL NOT RETURN to this hotel. However, the staff at the front desk was friendly - the only good thing about this stay!!	1.0
The hotel is exactly what it needs to be for Port Aransas-- conveniently located (10 minutes walk from the beach), affordable (we booked a large room with a mini fridge, king size bed etc for 39 per night during the off season), and the owners are attentive, informative and incredibly friendly. There is also a lovely cafe across the street... More	4.0

"My husband and I have been to Charleston multiple times and stayed at a lot of different places in the ""Historic Downtown"". This is out favorite! The staff is amazing!

Then they delivered the floaties to the pool!The hotel was also clean and so convenient to everything!"	5.0
This motel is reasonable, prices are good and the rooms are clean. I will be back and plan to stay again.

Bad: The house is built in another age - access to rooms and room size are not large - but OK. The rooms are not well insulated reg. noise. The other guests behaved very nicely - good clientele - but when the garbage truck etc. is working out back, you will know it! Bring your earplugs and you'll be fine. Good: Staff was very helpful, courteous and professionel in a good way. Front desk staff responded quickly to my requests (WiFi code renewal, instruction in how to make calls from phone in room, air-con etc). I ran into the sales manager as well - I think the new owners are putting a pretty good team together, who all know that customer satisfaction is king!	4.0
Pros: Hotel - On the beach, on the boardwalk, chair/umbrella/cabana tent rentals, outdoor pool bar (also services food), friendly front desk and pool area staff.

The lobby and breakfast area were very nice and clean. The girl at the desk was very friendly. However my non smoking room reaked of smoke and we found a container of chewing tobacco in the bedside table. My three-year-old also pulled out two 2 x 4 is from underneath the bed. The bathroom was clean.	3.0
We were in town to visit with our daughter and also see my brother. We stayed at the Hyatt House. The staff was friendly but not very empowered. Their directions on the ways you have to use the room key in the elevator and room were not very clear. We heard that over and over again as we went up and down the elevator with other visitors. The room had strange windows that looked out to the hotel interior. We missed having a window to do a quick weather check. The bathroom was spacious but had the most non-ergonomic faucet. Turning it on meant bumping your hand on the lighted mirror above the sink and that was unpleasant. All the elevators stopped working at one point and the staff only offered a free bottle of water despite the significant challenge for the hotel visitors. I observed a person in a wheel chair as one example. No help was offered for getting yourself or luggage to and from the lobby (besides a free bottle of water from the lobby shop). Although sometimes things happen, it is how the staff responds and this was a major disappointment. The free shuttle will take you up to 1 mile away if it is available or you can wait. The breakfast buffet was good, but they did not always restock items (including coffee lids) in a timely fashion. I don't recommend this hotel.	2.0
Overall we were very satisfied with our stay, here are a few comments: 1) the hotel staff is very friendly and helpful 2) We had two rooms and both were clean and nicely kept up 3) rather expensive for a Comfort Inn but given the location this is not surprising 4) breakfast is mostly plastic pre-prepared breakfast foods (typical of...

Everything was fine for a per-cruise hotel. There were a couple of places nearby to eat (Miller's Ale house I believe) and the hotel I think arranges for transport to the cruise ships.

This hotel is right on the river, which probably makes it the best one in Yuma.

I chose this hotel because the room had a kitchen, it was inexpensive, and it was close to the Hampton Convention Center (about 1/3 mile). The room was comfortable and clean, although the armchair, carpet, and bedspread needed to be spot-cleaned. There was a problem with my air conditioning unit which was fixed relatively quickly, even though it was a weekend. The staff was friendly.	4.0

The hotel was nice. The hallways were nasty though. The floor looked like they hadn't been vacuumed in months. The pool room was freezing. Couldn't take our 18 month swimming for very long.

We stayed here on our way out to a Midwest trip and it was very unsatisfactory. The pillows were down, which I am extremely allergic to. I tried calling the guest service who didn't answer, twice. Went down physically and they didn't have any allergy free pillows available for use. Recommended that I use bundled up towels to sleep on. The room smelled very bad when we arrived. The only redeeming factor was they had a nice pool / hot tub.	1.0

We spent 5 nights here in a regular room in December. The good: We loved the building's character, and old NYC charm. The location can't be beat. The butlers were overall very helpful, especially Emina. The car service is lovely, and the driver we had (Robert) was very nice. The concierges were interacted with (I have forgotten names) were both superb. Housekeeping was OUTSTANDING after the first night. Very much appreciated. The bell staff and doormen were also mostly really great. We felt very welcomed most of the time we interacted with staff.The not as good: A few minor misses upon entering room for the first time - there was some debris from prior guests. One of the butlers didn't provide the same great service as the others. Nothing to be totally fussed about, but these misses stand out all the more against the otherwise stellar service. Really the only true disappointment was that we weren't impressed by our Room Service breakfast at all - best to skip.Overall, we really enjoyed our time here and do recommend if it fits your NYC plans.Dear Nakoa G,Thank you very much for reviewing your recent stay at The St. Regis New York. We greatly appreciate you taking the time to write you review and provide us with your feedback. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your room and the Butler service, but are disappointed that you were not impressed with your Room Service breakfast.

Sorry..guess you get what you pay for...but a: NO hangers in room b. 1 chair (2 adults) c. No continental breakfast d. No pool It was 100 degrees when we checked in...at least the air-cond worked. Internet pass word was long enough to be aq security code for an IBM missile..	2.0
The bed was very comfortable, however the iron did not work properly and water seeped out of the bottom of the iron. Water drained from the bottom of the shower and I had to put towels on the floor around the shower to prevent falling. The room was dusty, the colors in the room were not inviting or appealing. I think a complimentary brunch would have been nice. If you are going to put coffee makers in the rooms at least give the customer something to stir the hot coffee.	3.0

Nothing spectacular. Good hotel. Kinda in the middle of stateline and actual SLT so walking seems kinda a pain. I thought they had redone the pool building entirely, but it was just a new facade.

Needed a place to stay before Baltimore based cruise. Hotel could use a shuttle service to the pier like other hotels in the area. Also need a direct phone line from the airport to hotel for shuttle service like other hotels and services. If I hadn't brought along the phone number, I would have been stuck. Wish there were other restaurants nearby. Also need a better selection of drinks for managers reception--I have stayed at many other Em.

This place needs a serious reno to stay alive. I booked with Expedia, specifically asked for 3 people in one room. The hotel still charged me 5 bucks extra for that, when we arrived.

Suncoast is off the strip about 20-30 minutes depending on how you drive. Vegas is easy to get around if you do rent a car. I have stayed in several LV hotels both on and off the strip but I honestly can say I was surprised at how nice the rooms were. The views are spectacular - mountains and golf courses- very peaceful. I'm a corner checker - I hate to see dirt in the corners of the bathrooms - every square inch was spotless! The crisp snow white bed covers reassured me of the cleanliness. We felt like we had a suite by both the size and the amenities. As we kept late nights we wanted to sleep The choice of restaurants is nicely varied and even has a Seattle's Best for the coffee drinker. They bring in some great music bands. I can't say enough about the well mannered and pleasant staff. Despite the line up check in was quick and pleasant. Loved the pool hot tub with the views of the mountains. Close to great shopping (5 min walk) , 15 minute from Red Rock Canyon State Park( rock climbing, varied degrees of hiking easy to tough), 20 min to Bonnie Springs (rustic restaurant, zoo fun for all ages) I would recommend this hotel without reservation!	4.0
This was just a terrible experience from check-in to check-out. When you arrive, there is only one person on the property. Get to the room and there is a leak, the microwave does not work and the bathroom is dirty. When they changed our rooms, it was a little better, but no refrigerator (I have four children, no refrigerator is... More	1.0
Arrived at the Hotel from Dulles airport at 15:50 the young man on the reception who introduced himself as B was at once friendly and welcoming and made a good first impression. The hotel although a bit dated is clean and easy to get around, the room I was in was spacious and with the benefit of it's own kitchen a blessing after a long day sight seeing. A shuttle bus runs frequently to and from the hotel to Rosslyn Metro station and the driver helpful and friendly, although if the weather is nice a walk down the hill is to Rosslyn and the Metro is no more than 10 minutes. All in all a good hotel and location with easy access to Washington DC.	4.0
Booked for a convention over a Friday thru Saturday recently, It was prudent to reserve my stay on the premises, although my customer loyalty cards recommended the hotel across from the golf course. Prices were not as low as many reviewers state for this hotel, two weeks prior the event but relatively expensive Friday and Saturday night stays (almost double the workweek day rate - and almost all hotels do this in Las Vegas, some more than others). Flights expensive from the East Coast this year, Saturday return some 100 cheaper than flying back on Sunday - and the red eye flights leave close to the date changeover time.The next shock came finding out about getting there from and to McCarran Intl. airport - it's apprx. 17 miles in distance, taxicab 60...70 when arriving late night! But what the hotel staff did not readily disclose - ther's a low-key bus (WestCliff Express) for two (2) dollars, that takes about 50 minutes (while still running along the highways) and makes its final scheduled stop less than a quarter mile/400m from the hotel entrance! Other participants of the convention took out rental cars (the hotel shuttle, price not known, last leaves hotel or airport by 6pm, so you're out of luck on eastbound red eye flights, that's where the bus really pulls its weight...)Enormous lobby areas greet you and hefty puffs of cigarette smoke - almost like good ole Europe (used to be...). The area appears more cluttered (efficiently equipped) with money machines than in some other hotels on and off the strip, making it a challenge to find your orientation and the concierge area, at first.Yes, the personnel really is friendlier here than in town, instead of the allocated room on the third floor, I requested one on a higher level and was granted one with an outstanding view of the golf course and the mountains. Clean room, with separate sink area vs shower/toilet area, albeit fixtures telling their heritage closer to the 80s than the 2000s. A flat screen TV (not HD)with a very limited program but a few music channels that are worth mentioning (and I couldn't turn it off at the end of a two night stay, not via remote or on the mainframe!) The biggest drawback were the enormous 4 AC motors below (the size of B757 engines) and their significant noise when at least two of the four fans were continuously running - mind, we had 107F (40C) outside temps during the day...Too bad, despite the weekend room rate surcharge, wi-fi was available only at another surcharge of 12,99/day, and amazingly, I managed without. No group discount (considering the conference) had been negotiated.A very opulent breakfast bar greets the all-nighter not before 8am on weekends, keep your gambling registration card handy as it will give you 2 meal discount, but prices are really reasonable for Las Vegas, the quantity or the quality. Likewise the prime rib dinner buffet, good job, guys! Please tip the friendly staff like Easterners...A solid good, not quite very good and I decisively wish to criticize the very draughty, excessively chilled conference rooms on the second floor (near the bingo hal) with no possibility of adjusting climate control clearly spells out that this hotel isn't latest generation any more.Would I recommend it heat-soaked LA drivers might find their sanctuary here, it's not close to the strip, but if you don't need access to downtown daily and are a little more cost conscious, this might just be your choice for a few days. Good luck in winning a jackpot!	3.0
The owner/operator take good care of this property. The room was clean and very reasonable, especially for the relatively low price they charge. The breakfast was free and have enough variety to satisfy most visitors. Compared to the price they charge for similar motels in the nearby Colfax, the price of this motel was almost half. It is a 25... More	4.0
After a weeks tour from San Francisco driving then all the way down the coast this was the perfect resting place for our final week.

I had booked a room via a 3rd party, but arrived late and the only room available was one for people with pets. I couldn't take that spring allergies would have had me sneezing all night in such a room. So the manager graciously gave me a suite at the same price. Nice service!	5.0
The whole place is a bit funny, the rooms are nice but old and so is the reception! Nice location, easy to find. Breakfast is.... bear claws type. A brewery down the road so is restaurants. Would stay again!	3.0
did not meet my expectations at all! I've stayed with this chain before and was impressed, but not this time! The eggs on the breakfast buffet were inedible and the staff disorganized and not prepared to deal with a crowd. Our room was not cleaned, ever. I had to call for clean towels. We used the hot tub, which wasn't hot, had weak bubbles and had tile missing. We ordered a movie and although the screen said we would be charged 14.99+tax, we were charged 17.99+tax. A complete ripoff!	3.0
This was our first trip to Hawaii and we spend several months planning. It will be easier next time because we plan to come back to this resort on our next trip. No complaints whatsoever.

The Saint Hotel in Key West is by far the very best boutique hotel on the island. The staff is beyond amazing - gracious and accommodating in every manner. Thank you for making every day a great day!The hotel and grounds are spotless, the pool area is an amazing place to totally unwind and relax. The music is perfect, and the sounds of the waterfall really set you up for a great day in the sun of Key West!My room was beautifully appointed with marble floors, modern furnishings, and a large marble bath. House keeping and turn down service was exceptional as well.I would compare The Saint to a 1,000 a night boutique hotel in South Beach - the vibe is cool, and you will not find it anywhere else in Key West!After staying here for a week, I HIGHLY recommend The Saint and can tell you this is the ONLY hotel in Key West that I will be staying at in the future - it can't be beat!Thank you for choosing The Saint Hotel and for the amazing review. Being a new hotel we depend on our reviews and we appreciate the wonderful words. We'll see you next time you're in Key West.	5.0
For basic accommodations, this place is perfect. Right in the center of town, welcoming staff, clean room, couldn't ask for more. With a restaurant on-premises, it was perfect for breakfast and great for sunset in the afternoon.	5.0
We stay at this hotel every year same time for an event at Angel Stadium the 1st weekend in Jan.We never have issues but when it rains it pours with this group...We checked in and they lost our reservation because I had called on a re-rate. They changed the name on the reservation, they changed it from a one bed to a studio and raised the rate from 109 to 129 We booked in Oct but 1st of Nov they put up a disclaimer that the hotel is under remodel...but the disclaimer was not on the webpage when we booked. Remodel is an understatement its a train wreck. There was 4 or 6 couches piled up in front of a cargo bin just sitting there with some other ragged furniture and lamps in part of the parking lot.Our 1st room was nice but getting to the room was a mess, floorboards missing, walls messed up, the door wide open to the electronics closet which cant be seen by the front desk so anyone could walk in and create havoc. I am sure there is credit card info in those backup etc.It was late about 10:30 and we rented a PPV and then we hear something in the kitchen area and its a rat that runs behind the stove and now is stuck and screaming. So we go down to the front desk and then send a guy up to try and catch the rat. He cant catch it so they tell us we need to move to the other building.We do and its a bigger mess then the 1st building. There is black goop all over the floor in leading to the elevator and then in the elevator too, the 2nd building is old,smells and needs remodel bad. The new room is 2 bedroom but its hit and miss, way to much furniture, kitchen is dated, microwave falling down, dusty and dirty and about a 3 gap under the front door so someone could look in if they wanted.When we tell them the room will not work they offer to move us back to the 1st building but to the room a joining the room with the ratIt was just a trip hotel from hell which is really sad because its normally an ok hotel. We book next time at Hilton.Was really disappointed that management didn't reach out to us in till we contacted them.John Dominguez Assistant GM useless!Thank you for rating us on trip advisor as we are always looking to improve our hotel and do well by all of our guests. As most business professionals I was not available during the weekend while you were here at the property: however, we always have a manager on duty.As we are currently undergoing renovations, we have the challenge of insuring that our hotel continues to operate with minimal disruption to our guests. We understand that finding a mouse in your room can be an unnerving situation and tried to put you at ease for the duration of your stay. My staff did need to relocate you to another room so that we could have an external company resolve the issue which has now been rectified and make sure that you had a comfortable and pest free stay.Im happy to see that my staff offered you an upgraded newly renovated accessibility suite that did not have any adjoining wall or door to the previous room. We are sorry that you declined it. My understanding is the manager also offered to purchase a shower chair as the remaining 16 accessible rooms were fully committed. The Suite that you were relocated to was an upgraded suite as an additional apology for the issue that occurred. In my email to you on Monday after you had departed I explained that the renovation construction team working in the building you had relocated to did in fact make scuff marks on the floor from the tires of the dolly's that they were using to move the larger furniture out of the rooms to make way for the new furniture that we were receiving. As we placed you in an un-renovated suite for the final part of your stay, I can understand why you would feel it was out dated as the renovation is to give us a more modern and updated look and this suite had not been completed as of yet. As per Marriott standard the renovation information was available to all guests as of the beginning of October prior to when your reservation was made. Jeanette the Manager on duty removed your charges for the first night due to the mouse incident, while isolated, is unacceptable. We sincerely apologize as no guest should ever experience that. As you have stated, you have stayed with us numerous times and have never had any issues.The room you noticed with the door opened was awaiting a new air conditioning unit, there is nothing in this room that would present a security issue for our guests. We will also be purchasing some extra assistance chairs to accommodate past our eighteen accessibility rooms. again our apologies that your stay was less than perfect. We hope that you will give us another opportunity to welcome you again during the annual super cross event at Angel Stadium.	1.0

They are renovating the inn, should not rent out the section they are working on. Not much of a breakfast.	3.0
Bad: The bathroom needs to be upgraded. It is very worn, the brown wall paper was dirty and the paint on the sink counter was pealing off. was also disappointed the room did not have a coffee maker. I like to have a cup while I get dressed in the mornings. would have liked a non-smoking area in the casino. I am a non-smoker and I had to keep taking breaks and go outside for fresh air.

Would rate 3.5 rather than 3.0 stars. Location boosts value. Convenient to Arlington National Cemetery. Shuttle available to Metro Station. Grocery store and restaurants nearby. Staff friendly and helpful. Although comfortable and clean, public areas, hallways and rooms are dated. Nearby stairs useful when the only two elevators are busy. Breakfast area on third floor has nice view, but included breakfast average. King suite a little smaller than expectations. Full kitchen nice, but did not use this trip. Additional daily charge for self parking. Overall, a little pricey for condition of property. Might stay again, but will run through all the available options and prices first.	3.0
This motel is reasonably priced, has a great location, beautiful pavilion complete with grills/smokers and picnic tables and easy access to the beach.

Upon arrival at this Best Western property, all staff members did 100 effort to make our stay comfortable. Great tips on local dining spots that turned to some of the best food we had on this trip.

My Husband and I stayed here last week after returning from a week long cruise out of Charleston. I usually stay at Marriott's or Hilton properties but thought we would try Holiday Inn Express. We were pleasantly surprised! This is a very nice property that has obviously just been renovated. The lobby was beautifully done, as were the rooms and breakfast areas. The staff all seemed eager to help and please. The General Manager seems like she is doing a great job and is hands on as I saw her at the Front Desk on a few occasions talking to staff and interacting with guests. I really appreciated the fact that they had laundry facilitites there to use also, considering we had a lot of dirty laundry from the cruise.The free breakfast was also a bonus as it wasn't your usual boring continental breakfast offerings. They had different items on each of the mornings we were there. Some were: Omelettes, sausage, biscuits, bacon and warm cinnamon buns! The coffee was great (and I am fussy with my coffee!) and they even had a pancake machine.While the location wasn't right downtown we did get a reasonable rate and there was a FREE trolley service right at the side of the hotel. We didn't use the car, instead just jumped on the trolley and were in downtown Charleston in no time!	5.0
Spent three days at the Western Inn. This stay was not planned ahead of time but I am so happy with the result. The rooms are clean and well kept.

Home2 Suites is a new hotel with modern decor. The room was nice with a small kitchen, table and desk and couch. The only drawback of the room was the bed was placed right next to the air conditioning unit, which is quite loud when your head is right next to it. The room was a good size.	4.0
The staff was very nice but the rooms are just old. Had a strange smell to the room and my daughter actually got congested while we were staying there. It may not have had anything to do with the room but you can't help but wonder. The breakfast was nice. Hotel just needs a major renovation. We felt safe in the area.	2.0

The hotel definitely shows age and tons of wear. We had two rooms both in somewhat poor condition that both smelled strongly of smoke (non smoking rooms). Stains, tears, and burn marks pretty much sums it up. Staff was very friendly!	3.0
We stayed here last year about this time to catch an early flight out of Pittsburgh. You can tell that the hotel is in the process of being renovated. Our room was done and looked great. The outside of the hotel was also being painted. The shuttle driver told us that the hotel was recently under new management and a lot of items that were left by the former management is now getting done.	4.0
My family and I stayed at this hotel last night. Everything was okay except for the swimming pool, it was cold. The breakfast was excellent (having waffles, danish, cereal, sausage, eggs, yogurt, beverages). The interior needs to be remodeled. The attendant was very friendly.	4.0
Bad: There was an anti-noise device plugged into each of two sockets to compensate for the fact they are in a noisy road. In fact, this emits itself a loud roaring sound. When unplugged, things were fine. The road noise was not bad at all (we were on the 12th floor). One of the senior staff kindly refunded a breakfast bill given this and another issue (cordless phone by the bed wouldn't stop beeping through the night). The restaurant and room service were extremely expensive. There was a slight sense too that some of the decor (wood-appearance veneer on cabinets, shower curtain not panel ) was a bit cheap and scuffed given the price. Good: Staff were great - thoughtful, friendly and clearly dedicated to running it well.Decor and atmosphere of front lounge area welcoming and stylish. Location is very good.	4.0
Nice accommodations. Breakfast included each morning. There is no pool in the hotel.

Pool was always clean and heated.	5.0
Stayed at hotel for a football game nearby. Shower didn't drain. Shower curtain didn't stay on the shower curtain rod. Maid never remade the room. Not enough power outlets handy to recharge the cell phones of the group in my room. Continental breakfast was so lousy, we ate breakfast elsewhere. Elevator was out of order upon arrival (was fixed during our stay). In dire need of a renovation. If you can book it for the same price as Motel 6, then go for it, otherwise avoid until a renovation occurs.	1.0
We have stayed at this hotel many times. I think it's great for families. My son loves the small arcade, bowling alley, movie theatre, pool and Friday's restaurant. I love the fact that the rooms are large, very clean and come with a small fridge. It is also great for families to have the shower and toilet area seperate. In addition to Friday's restaurant there are other restaurants including a 24 hour cafe and an ice cream shop that stays open late as well, very convenient. There are also shopping centers near the hotel that include just about every store and restaurant you can think of, Target, PF Changs, Mimi's etc. My parents had an odd numbered room and it overlooked the pool and golf course. My even numbered room overlooked a roof, not so nice. This is really the only negative I can think of. Also, pool area has no lifeguard or supervision of any kind, so some adults got a little unruly, drinking beer in the pool, speaking loudly etc. But, overall this is a nice place to stay off the strip, especially for those traveling to Las Vegas with children.	4.0
While this is a very nice hotel I can't say that it is better than others in the area charging a lower price.

We recently stayed at the Suncoast Hotel for a wedding we attended. This hotel was chosen by the couple, so we weren't sure what to expect. The staff was pleasant enough. Upon entering, we immediately noticed how strongly it smelled of smoke (much stronger than any other casino we've ever been in). Our room was spacious enough and clean, though dated somewhat in appearance. The toilet in our bathroom leaked a bit and the brass towel racks were all scratched up as well. The wallpaper was peeling off in a spot or two. Our toiletries were not replenished at all during our stay, but we didn't bother to call about it. The price of course is ridiculously low. My husband and I aren't big gamblers, so thought we would enjoy some time by the pool. We were surprised at how small the pool was and that there were no poolside servers. It is more like any backyard pool rather than a pool for a large casino. There is a TGI Fridays near the pool, which we were able to get drinks from and ate at a couple of times. The food and service there was very good. There is a bar by the pool, but it wasn't open at all during our 4 day stay. This property is a good 30 minute ride from the strip, which is about a 50 cab ride one way! For us personally, we would much prefer to stay closer in as we like to site see and visit different restaurants. The pool is also a large deciding factor for us as well.	3.0
My family decided to stay here the night after spending the day at Virginia beach before heading home. The hotel seemed ok and clean and all was well until about 1am. A couple arrived in the room next to ours and were fighting. It got so loud I had to call the front desk and while I was doing this the women was screaming that she was being beat. There was a lot of banging around and the manager along with someone else came up right away. They proceeded to call the police but when they got there the man had already left. This was a very traumatic experience for my wife and kids and management did not even try to talk to us about it. This was not an experience I would expect from a Hilton hotel. I know some things can't be controlled but management should have followed up on this. Based on this experience I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.	1.0
They charged me 150 for smoking in my room. I do not smoke. There was one person who did smoke in the room, at a wimdow, window were left open.

The hotel was great and just a block away from Discovery Kingdom. They have a shuttle that takes you from the hotel to the park and picks you up later. This will save you 25 a day in parking. The breakfast buffet was a great way to start your day. They have coffee and cold water for you at the lobby 24hrs so that is also a plus. The rooms are spacious with sofa beds and the staff is very friendly. This is a great value and an awesome place for a family trip.	5.0

Our room had been recently remodeled and was clean, comfortable and in a very convenient location. We were able to park just outside our room's front door making it easy to unload/load luggage. The Best Western Mesquite is a good value and close to good restaurants and excellent freeway access.	4.0
I reserved a room that turned out to be designed for a handicapped person, with all the fixtures, closet rods, ironing board, desks, etc., being much too low for my comfort. I was not made aware, in advance that the room was so designed. I am 6'4, so the accommodations were unusually uncomfortable for me. I was offered another room, but the hotel was unable to change my room due to it being reserved and paid via Expedia. I contacted Customer Service, and it is now 21 days, and I have yet to receive a response. I paid for 3 days, but only stayed for 2, as the accommodations were just unacceptable. I spent my last night at a competing hotel for about the same price, without issue. Of course I did not reserve that room via Expedia.	3.0
Overbooked the hotel and didn't have our suite available but the staff worked with us and gave us 2 rooms for the price of a suite which worked fine and the rooms were comfortable no problems with anything	4.0

I highly recommend this hotel as a place to stay. It's situated in Arlington a quieter,more idealic area than Washington dc itself although still very easy to visit all the attractions in DC via a short walk to Rosslyn, it's nearest metro.Hotel room was amazing value for money,very clean with a separate kitchen area.There is no hotel restaurant available and thekitchen was more than adequate to cook decent meals in. Our only complaint is that our gas cooker did not work and after mentioning it to the hotel it was never sorted out so we spent 2 weeks without a working cooker.As there is not much in the surrounding area we found ourselves having to travel into rosslyn and Washington to buy dinner.	5.0
My husband and I stayed with the Tass family for a week in August 2012. The Tass family allowed us into their lives to see how their ranch operates and to enjoy beautiful scenery from their horses.

Filthy hotel. There were long black hairs on our bathroom floor. Candy wrappers and other garbage in the hallways. We were on the second floor and took the stairs. Stay out of the stairwells.

I was pleasantly surprised. I've stayed at many Hampton Inns and have always been pleased, but this one was a cut above!

When we booked the hotel we knew that they were undergoing renovations so we expected some inconvenience. The checkin area was in a different location, all you needed to do was follow the signs. Checkin was fast. Our room was a 2 bedroom suite with a king in each room. The room was recently renovated and was absolutley beautiful. Plenty of room for 4 adults. We will be reserving a room again next September. There is shopping, food an liquor store right around the corner. The only downside was that our room was directly under the temporay breakfast cafe. If possible, that should be the last room to be checked into.	5.0

This is a pleasant family hotel. Although the weather was warm, the pool was closed, which was annoying. It's next to fast food places. It's right on the highway so it's a little noisy outside but the rooms are OK. You can see the lake across the highway but the rooms do not have lake views.	4.0

To be fair I went into this hotel with high expectations based off of multiple stays at the Redbury in LA. Its my go to in LA because of how amazing it is - it is my third or fourth hotel in the US hands down. The Redbury NYC doesnt compare. The hotel itself a little unkempt. Not in a trendy vintage way but in a needs some TLC way. We stayed in a deluxe double, the beds are really small, view was bleh, and there was a lot of construction across the street so it was noisy on our side early in the morning (not the fault of the hotel obviously) I can handle all the above and it wouldnt have been an issue however the service is what was so disappointing to me. The bellhop (if you can call him that) was rude and mumbled things under his breath after I asked for help to get luggage to the room. Note: I had to ask - when I was clearly walking in with two daughters and luggage. We called to the front to ask for cutlery, they said they would check and see if they had any and bring it up twenty minutes later my husband had to go and get it. We never heard from them. No one was overly friendly with the exception of two staff one being the housekeeper who was cleaning the rooms on the 6th floor when we checked in. She had great energy and went out of her way to ask what we needed and if she could help in any way. And the second was a gentleman who answered the concierge call when we had a few questions about parking. Outside of that this hotel really needs to step up there customer service game. See also my review of Marta. Same theme, very flat, non- engaging staff. Delicious pizza though. So its almost like you have a great product but your front line isnt selling it. Overall average which is disappointing for this brand. Thank you for sharing your feedback, Domenica.We regret that your experience with us was less than ideal. We're disappointed to hear the service you received wasn't up to par. Providing our guests with exceptional service is something we take seriously. Please know this will be addressed with the appropriate members of our team so we may improve for the future.We hope you'll give us another chance to show you the service we're truly capable of providing.	3.0
As an adult couple it was a little overwhelming to have a hotel filled with young people there for a competition. It was nearly impossible to take advantage of the breakfast service. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.	3.0
The Aria has it all!! It's large, bright, clean, has an amazing swimming pool area plus a gorgeous spa!! We had an amazing Thai meal which was lovely. The hotel is close by to everything and has a tram to other hotels too. When we come back to Vegas we will stay here again!!	5.0
Bad: Outside the center and hard to reach without car! Internet usage requires registration with many personal details. Good: Good offer for the price!	4.0
This place is just a pleasure in every way. Great staff, great rooms and great location. The hotel runs a shuttle to the airport which is really convenient. I love the gym and restaurant. In the heart of Bend and convenient to shopping, etc.	5.0

Comfortable, quiet, friendly staff. The lobby is amazing and a great place to meet for drinks. The room I had was small, but functional. Elevators were always available.Overall, this is a nice gem in downtown Philadelphia close to City Hall and restaurants. I highly recommend it.Todd,Being a part of the opening team, I have said from day one, even during construction, that our lobby would be the most beautiful and exciting in the city. It is always great to hear that our guests such as yourself feel the same! Our team is always working hard to ensure that you have a quiet and relaxing stay, and I am glad that you felt we were successful in that attempt. I hope we see you again soon!Best,Andrew DrydenAssistant General Manager	5.0
Bad: There was NOTHING we disliked! The room was small but that was to be expected and the two of us were very comfortable there. The room size and the narrow hallways gave the entire place the European feel... nothing wrong with that, right. Good: 1. Outstanding location! Close to the T, the airport shuttle, historic churches, Public Library (also an attraction in itself), Prudential SkyDeck, the amazing Newbury St. with all the shops and restaurants... I could go on and on. 2. Excellent staff - attentive, helpful, understanding, flexible... overall very pleasant without being over the top. 3. A small place that felt like home, without that big corporate hotel feel. 4. A good continental breakfast that never ran out of any items. 5. Free WiFi that ran very well. 6. Reliable cooling/heating system. 7. All the small details such as nice toiletry items, modern plumbing, detachable shower head, hairdryer, iron, a huge mirror... Thank you, CharlesMark! We hope to stay there again.	4.0
The host and hostess are real nice. The hotel is very old, with steep stairs.

Econolodge it is. It was cheap in price, and accommodations as well. Rooms looks just like what the name implies an old roadside motor lodge.

Of course it is very beautiful, and from its look you might think that it would be stuffy, but it is not- Very friendly and welcoming staff, and the Head Butler, Nestor, on the 7th floor could not have been a better representative in making us feel at home!

Actually always wanted to stay at the St. Regis, and this did not disappoint!Dear Diane,We are thrilled to hear how much you enjoyed your stay, and that Nestor made you feel at home.

The 1 asset of this motel is its proximity to the beach which is just one block away. The room was quite large and included cable TV and a kitchen.

Check-in went smoothly. Staff was very professional and helpful. The room smelled a bit stuffy and the air conditioner could have used a change in its filter. The room overall was clean tidy. The morning breakfast selection was okay. It offered the waffles and fruit, etc., I wished they had prepared the oatmeal instead of providing instant packets. Some of the fruit was very ripe and not as fresh as it could have been. Plenty of parking and close to the interstate.	4.0

First I want to say we had amazing customer service! They let us check in our bags early, the maid service was great (we tip them, you should too!) the shuttle was on time to the airport and the driver helped us with our bags (tip him too!)However, the heated indoor pool was not on. This is my main reason for choosing Drury, since I have children who love to swim. We were disappointed. The food, another reason we choose Drury, was not edible. There was popcorn made once a day, around 10 am, and there it sat all day. I will stay at Drury again, but not this one!	1.0

Free parking. That's the only positive experience here. Any more than 1 night would have canceled found different hotel. Hotel had a funky smell in lobby and room was musty smelling too.

I was very apprehensive about staying here having read some reviews and have come to the conclusion that only complainers write reviews. We had a wonderful stay in a cheerfully lit spotless room, with gracious staff which was also an excellent value The rates even went down and we were offered the lower rate. I would gladly stay here again... More	5.0
I want to emphasize that the problems I describe here were dealt with by the overworked night staff (desk manager and shuttle bus driver/handyman who went out of their way to solve the problem of our room. I have stayed in this hotel over the years but this was worst experience and perhaps the last time. It looks as if management has cut staffing to the bone. At hotel desk I waited for nearly 20 minutes. The clerk was with a guest of the hotel who had a problem. The guest explained the problem at least five times the clerk kept forgetting details -- because he never wrote anything down -- instead repunching the same mistakes into the computer over and over again. No one else came out to help and he kept repeating mistakes. The guest, a businessman, was very patient and stepped aside to let me check-in. The clerk finally got to me. We loaded up a baggage cart and went up to the sixth floor. We found a nice room at well over 100 degrees. It is seemed as if policy is to completely turn off air conditioning between guests. Downstairs lobby was cool and pleasant. Upper level lobbies and room were very hot. Room faced afternoon sun directly unshaded. We set the AC on cool hoped for the best. I went downstairs to use the business center which is a computer in an open area with children playing on it. A child got up but no obvious reset function for privacy and screen faced a group of children hanging out. Hotel also needs to reduce loitering in parking lot.	2.0
The only complaint I have about this hotel is that my sink was stopped up, but they did come and fix it right away. The toilet was running and continues until our stay, but that didn't bother me too much. They were repaying the parking lot and didn't have it posted anywhere and with them having the bar downstairs you had to park way over by the other building and walk to the hotel.	4.0
I stayed for two nights (Saturday and Sunday) for concerts at Merriweather Post Pavillion. Due to the extreme volume of people checking in at the front desk upon my arrival, I was given a key to a room that was already occupied.

Had a 7:30am tour of the White House and wanted to be near public transportation (New Carrolton Station). Metro Points fit the bill and was recently renovated. A good price from Expedia sealed the deal for us. Upon arrival we found the staff to be helpful and friendly. The two adjoining rooms were clean and well appointed. Local amenities offered a wide choice of restaurants, and a local IHOP was open 24x7 to support our early morning breakfast and travel needs. MetroPoint even provided a 15 discount. We would definitely stay again.	5.0

The main features of this property are its close proximity to the beach and comparatively low price. The rooms are small and a tad cramped, and feel a little damp and musty, even with the (old) AC units running all day. But the beds and facilities were OK, the staff were all very courteous and helpful, and there was a reasonable hot breakfast on the premises. It was good for three nights, but we wouldn't want to have stayed longer.	3.0

I was very excited about the occasion - our short honeymoon (longer one to follow on our first anniversary) but was disappointed by one thing...the bathroom in the DoubleTree was so small that you had to actually come into the room and move over to the side JUST to close the door. Maybe it was because we had the special price rate, but I expected better from a Hilton brand hotel... Other than that, the room was nice, average size and the staff was very friendly. When they saw us come in (we were still in tux and wedding gown), they offered congratulations and of course, the cookies were excellent!!!	4.0

Between the front desk (too many greats to name) to Hussain and Israel (tenth floor butlers), to the great staff at King Cole's, this is an excellent property. I have stayed in the Four Seasons, Ritz, and elsewhere, and found this to be a great place. Highly appreciated. Room was great, but as is clear from the hotel business, property is secondary to service.Service rules, and the St Regis staff is excellent. Kudos to Krista the concierge (not to miss the stars). I recommend this hotel. Expensive, yes, but value received.Dear rowingman,Thank you so much for sharing your kind words about our staff.

We had difficulty finding this motel. It is closer to Knott's Berry Farm over Disneyland. The check in lobby smelled of urine. The hotel does not have a lift of any sort for the second floor, therefore consider this if climbing stairs is an issue....More	2.0
I was very disappointed in the Wingate by Wyndham LaGrange. I initially liked the hardwood floors when we entered our room- definitely cleaner than carpeting. However, it sounded like the guests above us were moving furniture around and doing some serious stomping until about 3 am. Carpeting would have muted some of this noise. Our room air conditioner sounded like... More	2.0
location and staff were great! Room, not so much. Trash wasnt emptied, hair in tub and top comforter on one bed didnt look to clean. Price and location were main reason for chosing this place -again staff and breakfast were nice	2.0

My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel for one night while we were vacationing in Napa Valley with another couple. The hotel is located in a commercial area, so it lacks the ambiance of a hotel that is located in the hear of wine country. And it is a bit of a longer drive to get to the main roads where the wineries are located.That being said, the lobby of the hotel is very nicely appointed and they do have a good offering of bottles of wine for sale. The staff at the front desk were very nice and were helpful with recommendations and directions. Our room was very comfortable. There was plenty of space and the beds were firm and friendly. The bathroom was clean and included the expected amenities. It was also a very good value, as similar hotels in the area were significantly more expensive. If you're looking for a comfortable place to stay close to Napa Valley and you're not looking for a romantic experience, this hotel would be an excellent choice.Dear ltt18,Thanks for taking the time to write your review of the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We appreciate your valuable feedback. As our location is less than 2 miles to downtown we are very close to several wineries in surrounding areas like the Carneros area as well as conveniently near the entrance to highway 29 to reach the other wineries up the valley. It's great to hear that the staff was nice and provided you with recommendations as well as directions to your destinations. At Hampton we provide a great value with complementary breakfast, parking and internet just to name a few. Thank you again for staying with us and we hope to see you on your next trip to Napa. Best Regards, Serina Najar.	4.0
My wife and I enjoyed a short stay at the Pousada Suites in Hollywood Beach. This great little hotel is just a block from the beach. The rooms are clean.

The staff was very friendly and courteous. Sleeping was difficult due to nearby highway and hvac unit noise. TV and Internet worked well. The plaster work on the ceiling was unsightly and needs repair. Ceiling lamp had dead bugs. Breakfast was very good.	3.0
Love staying here. Frequent this location for work. All of the staff is extremely friendly and courteous. Room is always exceptionally clean. They have free beer, wine, and food on some weeknights. Will keep coming back for sure!	5.0
We had a wonderful time! The breakfast buffet was delicious and lots of variety! The staff was very friendly and helpful. Only downside was the elevator was broke for 2 days of our stay but glad we were only on the 4th floor. The free shuttle to the metro was awesome and saved us so much in parking and the hassle of DC traffic. The room was clean and housekeeping provided our needs in necessities.	5.0

Located in the Arena District, walking distance from Arena, many restaurants and pubs. Rooms were typical of a hotel layout. Everyone was nice and attached to a restaurant (Max and Erma's) where you got you breakfast.	4.0
Very comfortable room. Our son came and they had a couch that they pulled out into a queen size bed. Free wifi and bottled water. This hotel was built back in the 20's and the decor is fabulous. A very neat hotel.	5.0

Jack Huff's has delivered again. We've found this to be one of the best hotels we've ever stayed at. The rooms are bigger than the major chains, friendly staff and clean. It's a little old school with reservations and room keys but we'll worth it.	5.0
I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting San Antonio! The room was so spacious and comfortable to be in. Large living area with comfortable couch and big tv. Breakfast was great with plenty of options to choose from. The front desk staff and maintenance/cleaning people were so friendly and kind. My husband and I were very pleased with our stay! Thank you!	5.0

We recently stayed one night at the SeacCrest Oceanfront Hotel on our way down the coast after driving the Big Sur and visiting Hearst Castle.

I want to first say that this hotel is in a prime location. You are steps away from the trolley pick up for city place and clematis. Upon arrival I thought the hotel was very nice.

The property is clean and well-maintained. The staff works hard to make you feel comfortable. The free breakfast is good, although it could use some more fruit.

The room was clean but needs maintenance, wallpaper coming off the wall in the living room area of our suite. It is an older building and bathroom did not have extra outlet for appliances such as curling iron. It was nice and convenient having the kitchen. Good location! Convenient to many of the Arlington/ DC sites.	3.0
Stayed from Monday thru Friday and the last couple days were not very pleasant. Staff is very friendly and I always felt welcomed! Thursday house keeping was awful. I asked for clean bathroom towels everyday and they gave me dirty bathroom towels! They also gave me a dirty pillow case! Had to call the front desk two times. Was told I had to wait to get new clean bathroom towels and pillow cases because they were in the washer. This was at 5pm in the afternoon. Thankfully, Alex who works at the front desk was very nice and brought up new towels and pillow cases. He was also very apologetic. Friday my beds were not fixed and house keeping just dropped the towels off without doing anything in the hotel room.	3.0
Very good location, close to metro and a supermarket. Lots of restaurants surrounding. Free breakfast has plenty of hot foods. Free wifi is quite slow. Overall the hotel is good, price also good. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends.	4.0
Spotless room, comfortable bed, free wi fi, caring and efficient staff. Well located, near the downtown area, close to main highways and wineries.

Clean rooms, comfortable bed and great service is what we strive for. Come back and see as again.	5.0
A nice property conveniently located near the Commons Mall and right off the Interstate - rooms are large and comfortable, a good pool and exercise space - they have a small bar and restaurant with a limited menu.

Location is perfect, right across from Santa Monica pier and we walked to Venice Beach in the morning (2 miles each way). Also walking distance from 3rd avenue shops so really perfect location.

This my second stay here and it has been great - consistent, predictable quality. I highly recommend it. Easy to find with a couple of good restaurants in the area then back on the road in the morning. A road warrior's dream!	5.0
Oustanding hotel, clean and spacious. However, hotel cannot be found on GPS.	5.0
Don't expect anything other than a fairly decent place to sleep. When we checked in, the two coffee pots were empty. We asked for another pillow and were told one would be sent to the room. We never got it. There is no tissue (Kleenex) and don't expect complimentary shampoo and conditioner. In the morning when we checked out, the coffee pots were still empty. Having said all that, the room was clean and bed was pretty comfortable. Bathroom was clean and shower was hot so if that's what you are looking for, you will be satisfied.	3.0
Bad: Car was freshly washed before we arrived to valet the car. 3 days later, the car was filled with hard water marks from the sprinklers and now we need to get the car detailed to remove the spots. A bit frustrating to not get the car back in the same condition... Good: Location great, staff was pleasant, buffet was good and the chef that made the omelet was amazing	5.0

I have booked this hotel for employees on several trips for an installation project in town. I have gotten several great reports from each trip by employees. The staff and manager are always kind, courteous, and on top of things. Rooms are always clean and inviting. The hotel is centrally located for restaurants, beach, businesses, and shopping.	5.0
Very dissatisfied with the staff and the lack of caring about at least 5 different guest (that we know of) not being able to check in until after 5:00 pm because rooms weren't ready. It's a Holiday weekend you would think they would be staffed a little better. They are less than a mile away from a theme park and should no how busy they would be especially on a holiday.	2.0
Room was nice, recently updated and comfortable. The staff was great--friendly and responsive. The location was walking distance to all the Waikiki attractions such as the beaches, etc, but far enough away that it was quiet.	3.0
Great place to stay in Madison. The rooms are very quiet and clean. The beds are very comfortable and the shower is fabulous. Our large dogs loved the special dog treat bag they each received which is a thoughtful addition to the room package! We will be back :)	5.0
A great location for beautiful sunsets, great food close by, and whale watching! We really enjoyed our stay.	5.0
There was a lot of miscommunication between me and the hotel pickup service. I used the metro the entire time I visited D.C. When I would get back I would have to be picked up at the Franconia-Springfield station or else it would take the driver over an hour to come pick me up, even if it was near the hotel. Additionally, there was not shuttle to Reagan National Airport. I had a flight to catch at 6:00 AM so the metro was out of the question, since it doesn't run until 5:00 AM. The hotel couldn't do because it was too far away. They were promoting a taxi service that was going to charge 40 to get to DCA. I was not impressed with this taxi service when I needed a ride from near the Hilton Hotel to Best Western (this cabbie thought New Mexico wasn't part of the U.S.). So I did use Uber to get to DCA.	2.0

Bad: Nothing. Good: Rooms were big and very clean, the smell of the room was awesome. The staff are very friendly and the location is perfect	5.0
Bad: The bed/mattress was not as firm as I like. Good: The hotel staff was incredibly attentive and sent us a bottle or Prosseco and chocolate covered strawberries to help celebrate our anniversary. It was such a welcome surprise that really made our stay special. We also appreciated the drink tokens and lounge area with appetizers- made it very comfortable to stay there!	5.0
We checked in at 3.30 am and the lady at the front desk didn't seem happy to see us. No greeting or smiling. She quickly gave us the keys and didn't bother to give us any information on breakfast timings or free wi fi. She was rude in short. The guy during check out was very friendly. The room was clean but the beds were very hard. The trash can in the room was nasty and when i looked at it by mistake i lost my appetite. It wasn't bad, but not worth the price i paid for it. For 10 more i could've stayed at bigger hotels close to it. Oh and breakfast wasn't anything to die for. We ended up not eating there.	3.0

We came to Redding to handle a family tragedy when my wife passed away.

Awesome hotel. Virgin really took the time to figure out all things at are frustrating about staying in a hotel and fixed them - kudos!!! The hotel will become a regular haunt in the future. From free wifi, free cocktails, a mini bar you're not terrified to touch, not to mention the no check out time, they really are way ahead of the rest. Oh by the way did I mention the really cool room... Awesome! Highly recommend the hotel. From young teens to my parents in their 70's the hotel met our every need.	5.0
Bad: Room was a lot smaller than I expected, and seemed a bit rundown. Not to mention we were supposed to be on a floor that was nonsmoking. The floor smelled of a smoking lounge. Good: Location and staff were awesome. Had a great view of Freemont street from our room.	3.0
Heating and AC are big on my list of things that need to work just right. The system they have here is perfect.

Valet service takes too long. You can try to call before, but with me they never picked up the phone. Advice is to get down 30 min before you need your car. Staff was very kind when you managed to get hold of them. Good property overall, specially for the price.	4.0
Very convient location, but a little difficult to get to off the interstate.. You need to make a right at the light and make a U turn. The room was nice size, had a fridge and micro. No oder untill we turned on the AC unit.. nothing a little frebreeze in the filter didnt fix. The walls were a little thin, but didnt matter much, as the puppy heard everything and anything from a mile away.. hahahaha.....The front desk folks were just great. Some of the friendliest I have run across in hotels. Breakfest was good, Waffels, cereal, juice, coffee.. ect. Will def stay there again because of the pet friendly/no fee.	5.0
Opted to stay here and commute to downtown for my meetings to save on hotel expenses of the downtown hotels. If you are willing to do that, it works. hotel has basic amenities, nothing more. It's basically a highrise motel...rooms are all suites with stove, microwave,etc. 10-15 minute walk to metro. Shuttle operates only on weekdays.	3.0

Bad: Bed bugs. Room too small. Too expensive When I was going to sleep, I found some bed bugs in my bed. It's terrible! I went to lobby to find someone help me. The receptionist helped me change a room. This room is even smaller than the previous one. I can't sleep all the night because it's too noisy, and I am still afraid of the bugs. The next day, I told the receptionist I would like to check out, even I booked for 3 night. She agreed, but didn't give me any compensation. I paid 300+ for a room which had bugs and was noisy, small. Good: The attitude of staff.	2.0

We booked and paid in full a month in advance. We arrived late to be greeted by front desk telling us we had no room available. It was common practice to overbook. We spent 2 of our 3 days moving from hotel to hotel as a result. They did not even call us ahead of time to tell us to check In elsewhere.

Clean comfortable hotel. Dennis the shuttle driver provided a tour into Newport and back to the hotel that was better than paid tours in Boston and Manhattan we have been on. He was the highlight of our trip. We are frequent visitors to Newport but never knew the history. We learned the different neighborhoods and restaurant choices other than harbor side. Breakfast on his recommendation was great! The free breakfast at Hampton is not why we stay there. The cleanliness and security is the most important feature to us. Someone needs to recognize Dennis for his efforts!! We will be back because of this A1 service.Thank you for taking the time to share your experience at our hotel with the TripAdvisor community. We appreciate your kind words and compliments regarding the cleanliness, comfort and security of our location. I will be certain to share your accolades with Dennis who will be thrilled to receive them. He is a tremendous asset to our team. We look forward to having you as our guests again upon your return to Newport. Again, thank you for your feedback.	5.0
The resort is very centrally located, and the staff was great. On the downside, the internet was really slow and at times, nonexistent. The units are clean but are in desperate need of updates.

I rated low because of the fire alarm that came on at 4:19 in the morning, we needed that sleep because we are expected to perform well at our bowling tournament the next morning.. Our sponsors are not happy with our performance.... We could not get to sleep after that, but we did try, then just when I started to fall asleep again, the alarm came in again at 5:38 (sometime around then )... So since I wasn't offered any compensation,. Not sure if we will return... By the way, your staff is really great!... The food was great, should have opened earlier since the alarms kept everyone up...	2.0
Bad: To be honest, nothing to complain about. Just too bad that there wasn't any free wifi in the rooms. Good: Considering that we only paid 88 dollars for 2 persons for 2 nights, this was great value for money. The hotel is located in the middle of Fremont Street, so you just step outside and you are in the middle of the action. Our room was on the 9th floor and we didn't hear any noise whatsoever. The room was maybe a bit old fashioned, but still offered everything you need. We were positively surprised that we had access to the pool and gym of the California hotel. We just needed to walk 2 mins to access their facilities. The gym was really good equipped for a hotel gym. Pool was really nice and quiet. Would definitely stay here again!	5.0
Hotel room was clean but room smelled musty. Outside walkway and steps could use some work. They do offer breakfast. Cheap rate so don't expect much. We only stayed one night. It was better then tent.	3.0
We rarely were able to park near our room, and the one time we did another guest slammed their car door into our motorcycle. There was no real enforcement of any of the rules or common courtesies. The pool was only open until 1000 each night even though it is in a resort town were most activities run well into the evening. We were only able to use the pool once our entire stay. We used the laundry our last day there before our trip home and some of our clothes were stolen from the dryer. There was supposedly cameras there but we were told they could not access the video from them. Out of the entire 5 nights we were there the maid only serviced our room twice, but they were sure to leave a tip card in the room. If the service was exemplary we would have tipped them on our own. The balconies were covered with spiders. We told the front desk twice about it and their reply was to have the maid sweep it off. They then turned the lights off for the rest of our stay. Now we could not see the spiders on the chairs, the railings, and the doorways. Needless to say, no one used the balconies. Refridgerator in the room was not turned on, and when we did turn it on it was noisy and ineffective. The hotel itself looks like it needs updated badly. The beds were lumpy and the pillows uncomfortable. The walkway around the hotel along the water was dirty and in poor repair as well.	2.0
I will never stay here again. No elevator. We were located on the second floor, not handicap accessible. I'm not handicap but it's doing a real number on my knee. Sheets are yellow. Cigarette burns in a non-smoking room. Smelled musty. Stains on the chair. Mold on the ceiling above the bed. Dust and cob webs behind the chair. T.V.... More	1.0
Stayed here for the Steelers vs Colts game in December. The hotel staff was extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and courteous. Prior to booking I was worried about the location and how easy it would be to get to the stadium, but taking the T was extremely easy, safe, and clean.

Just stayed one night but very happy. Nice, comfortable top floor room. Staff could not have been more helpful. Great location right by the Power Light district. Be prepared to pay for valet parking. Price of this was Offset though by free wine and cheese reception.	4.0
Overall the staff, hotel cleanliness and the amenities like breakfast was up to my satisfaction. Even though the Hotel had signs apologizing for renovations I am so happy that we didn't hear or had any complaints concerning the renovations. We didn't even notice the people or rooms being renovated. My stay was enjoyable with piece and quiet all around just like I love my stays. The only complaint which wasn't a big issue for me was the slow internet service provided. Although it was complimentary free wifi, I think I would of paid a few dollars for quicker faster internet wifi services on my stay. No biggie if you don't need it. The bed was more comfortable than I had expected I give you guys 5stars on comfort and cleanliness! I will be coming back here on my next stay!	4.0
Lovely place and very friendly staff. Although no shuttle was available from the Amtrak station, they did offer to send a limo driver. He was waiting for us as promised and charged 25, which seemed very reasonable. Hotel was clean. Breakfast was typical for a free hotel breakfast, nothing outstanding, but certainly more than adequate. Walking distance to key downtown sites.	5.0

We stayed here for a night and absolutely loved it. The hotel staff were courteous, helpful, and very personable.

Was not impressed! We only stayed here because it was close to Disneyland on our last night staying in California. We got in close to midnight. I had called to confirm earlier that evening letting them know that we were going to check in late-that was not a problem. Everyone was tired and just wanted to sleep. The A/C was always on. It did not turn off and we tried everything. Beds were uncomfortable-Difficult to sleep. Woke up to make coffee in our room. Coffee maker did not work.	2.0

This motel was close to the airport and only a short drive from a shopping mall and many fine restaurants. The staff was very pleasant and helpful.

We were invited to the wedding of a close family member in San Diego with only 3 weeks notice. A friend got us two rooms at Rodeway Inn Qualcomm at a discounted rate to help us with travel expenses. We received our confirmations 15 days prior to check in.On the very morning we left for San Diego, we received a phone call from the manager of Rodeway Inn Qualcomm telling us we were not eligible for the discounted rooms, and our reservations had been cancelled. There was no offer to keep the reservations at the standard rate the reservations had simply been cancelled and the rooms were no longer available. When asked why he would do this on the day we were due to check in, the manager basically told us he did it because he could.We understand that hotel policies may limit the availability of discounted rooms, but we should have been notified earlier so we could make other arrangements. We set off to San Diego with no accommodations. This was certainly the worst customer service we've ever experienced at any lodging establishment.	1.0
I stay in HGI all the time and usually it is reliably clean with very pleasant staff. Our room was fairly worn and not someplace you would want to walk barefoot. More than that, the staff weren't super helpful - stingy on the tiny shampoo bottles when I asked for more (I was traveling with 3 daughters with a lot of hair), refused to let us have breakfast even though we arrived before 10am (granted it was 9:55am but the full buffet was still sitting there). To top it off, the pool is only open at night on weekdays even though it was a holiday weekend Monday.	2.0

Free parking, Free Wifi. Relative to other similar hotels of this calibre the price was approximately double that of what we were used to be paying.

The walls had unpainted spackle. There was a loose bulb hanging from bare wires in the bathroom. I told the front desk the bulb was a safety hazard and should be replaced but they didn't bother to fix it. I got the impression that they don't care about the condition of their own hotel.	1.0

More	4.0
Bad: being told we had missed our free glass of wine as we arrived to late, how hard would it have been to just give us a glass, also being told no free breakfast included as we booked via bookings.com, when you book with bookings.com you want to feel valued not at a disadvantage. no kettle, what is it about Americans not putting a kettle for a nice cup of tea in each room, you will get liters of alcohol to buy but why not just put a 12 dollar kettle and two mugs, costs so little but means so much. would boost my scoring on every hotel review i do. Good: position on south beach road is great, roof top pool great, nice room, hotel a little tired, stained carpets cracked bathroom work tops etc. my advice would be replace carpets in room halls ways from lift to room. lots of stains. iced water by lift this is great. lovely bed and pillows.stayed one night, lovely lady on reception day we left, helped us get a taxi. I would stay again however its expensive a bottle of water in the room is about 6 dollars, drank in error not understanding it was a cost option. drink iced water in reception, very nice.	3.0

The Club Quarters is a good hotel to stay at if you are looking for a place to stay with a good price and within walking distance to clubs and the Toyota center. We were able to take a short 10 minute walk to the Toyota center at night as well as bars and clubs nearby. The only complaint I would have is that parking is not free as the hotel itself does not have a parking area. There is a parking lot nearby where you can pay for meter parking but need to insert cash into the meter every so often which is tricky because you can forget. Valet price wasn't bad, 25 for 24 hours and you can come in and out as many times as you want with no extra charge. We chose this option and it worked out great because we didn't have to worry about our car. Hotel has free water bottles downstairs, a keurig machine in the rooms, a kitchen area with a small fridge, stove and microwave and glassware inside the room, and a coffee machine in the lobby.	4.0
I arrived at this hotel during a work trip at 1 am. I encountered brown water coming from the sink and several cockroaches in the hallway. I slept there because I had nowhere else to go.

We use this hotel for our overnight on the way to and from the Summit Bechtel Reserve. This is a low price place that is close to SBR.

Great place to stay in the keys at an affordable price without sacrificing quality. Location: not on the beach but within driving/ biking distance to downtown and quiet. On site is a biking company to rent bikes or scooters from definitely recommend. Their kiosk is located next to the pool bar.Room: clean room, clean bedding/sheets, bed was medium comfort but we slept fine Pool: beautiful and big it wasn't crowded at all so you could enjoy it an any time. Lounge chairs were comfortable and cabanas were nice on a first come first serve basis. The pool bar was very nice with a variety of drinks. I wouldn't recommend the pool food with the exception of the wings and fries which were really good. Try some of the local beers on tap my favorite was the Crazy Lady very smooth. Free Breakfast: continental breakfast with a variety of fruits, waffles, eggs, bagels, cereal, and coffee etcOverall : Had a very relaxing and fun two day stay here. I highly recommend it to anyone going down to the keys. I definitely plan to be back here on my next trip down. Dear Susana L,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel.

I used to live in Phoenix and I recently moved away. I love this area because of the restaurants and places to drink. I stayed here for a wedding that was at the Phoenix Art Museum and couldn't be happier with my stay. The hotel is very open and has a modern feel. The bar and restaurant are has covered outdoor seating if you want to enjoy some rays while enjoying a bite to eat. The Vietnamese Iced coffee drink was my favorite at the bar. The pool was on the smaller size and there weren't that many loungers to lay on, but there was good sun and good tunes. The studio room was modern, had a ton of towels, 2 bathrobes, and 2 slippers. The room is what I would want in a studio apartment with a comfy bed, a place to sit and drink coffee, and a desk for doing office-y type stuff. I don't like putting my clothes in drawers, so it wasn't a problem for me that there weren't any drawers or cabinets. A lot of places to hang your suits/dresses if you're in town for business or a wedding. Thank you so much for this awesome review. We hope you will choose us again when you make it back it to Phoenix.	5.0

We travel to Six Flags over GA pretty frequently. This was our first and last time for staying at this hotel. I'm generally a 4-5 star reviewer of hotels, with the occasional 3 star, here and on Trip Advisor, but this was my worst experience. There are plenty of problems with this place, but I'll start with the pros:Pro: Location to 6 Flags and room comfort. Both of these and parking were fine.Cons: It is not an overstatement to say this was the worst check in experience I've ever had, and not one interaction with staff the rest of the stay would change that. From walking into the hotel to check-in to finally walking into my room was probably 45-60 minutes, and when you are traveling with family, it's late at night, and you have to get up early, that's 45 minutes you can use. I walked in to the hotel, and I was probably 3rd or 4th to check in, and the line never moved as it took them forever to resolve what appeared to be simple problems. I don't know what the other customer issues were, but they weren't the problems. By the time I got there, I could see why it took a long time. A routine check in with reservations took longer here then anywhere else. When I did finally get my room keys, I go up to room with family who have been waiting WAY TOO LONG, and the keys don't work (and yes, I've stayed in enough hotels to know how to use hotel key cards). So after trying for several minutes, I go back down to front desk, wait in line for about 5 more minutes for the two workers to take care of routine check ins, and have the worker re key the cards again (and this time I watched to make sure he did them, and they did work when I returned to room).In my room, I check the safe, and on the safe it has the note about if you don't want to be billed for not using the safe, tell front desk on check out. So the next morning, I tell front desk we didn't use the safe, and yet, he still put it on my bill and would not remove.And this is why I think it is a Quality Brand issue. They aren't checking on their hotels at all. This comment has been made repeatedly on this website and the Choice Hotels website, but it is a problem.On the 3rd floor, the elevator has only 1 button, since you can only go down, but the arrow points up (little thing that make no difference on my stay, but demonstrate lack of care). The privacy door latch was put up backwards, so that it couldn't do anything to keep someone from opening the door. These lack of attention to details isn't a big thing by themselves, but the accumulation of them is a general sloppiness in maintenance that is apparent.Dear Guest. I would like to personally apologize for the series of unfortunate incidences that you experienced during your stay with us. We continually try to do our very best for all of our guests, but unfortunately, sometimes we do fail. I will look into each issue that you have noted, in an attempt to correct and improve our hotel policies. Sincerely, Hotel Manager	1.0
When I arrived at the hotel the service I received from Shannon at the front desk was absolutely amazing.. She helped me take my luggage upstairs without any hesitation. She later called my room to make sure everything was acceptable to my needs and then she was back in the morning to help me all over again.. The kind of... More	5.0

This is the worst Hampton Inn we have stayed in so far this trip. Drapes didn't close,so I had lights in my eyes all night. Control panel on AC didn't work, could only get cold or heat and that blew the flimsy curtains open. Nightlight wasn't working. Candy machine had melted candy. WiFi was extremely complicated to get on and... More	2.0
Bad: When two people sleep in the bed you settle to the middle of bed and makes for a uncomfortable night's rest. Good: The hotel location and the room layout and scenery was very nice.	4.0
Target, Wal-Mart, food establishments are in walking distance. The airport is 10 mins away and the shuttle is always available. The property is brand new, every inch of the suite/room was magnificent with the marble in the bathroom. I washed clothes (complimentary wash/dry). Loved it. Workout room has all the up-to-date equipment. Front desk hospitality from beginning to end of my stay. I'm from Los Angeles/Orange County, California, and a very neat and clean person. I will most definitely be back. The drive to Virginia Beach is very close, freeways are right at the location. Highest recommendation and respect for this hotel.	5.0

I booked this hotel for our layover stay in Atlanta due to the proximity to the aquarium. Great hotel, extremely friendly and helpful staff, and the restaurant attached had amazing food! I highly recommend!	5.0
The lobby was small, but modern. The valet and check in staff were great. We had a package that included breakfast. We ordered and put both orders on one slip (Why waste paper), but the hotel charged us for one breakfast because they were not written on TWO separate tickets. The food was not so great. Pre-cooked and microwaved. Not worth the money. The room was great, but we had a corner room. The waterpressure could have been better. Overall, not too bad. Not my first choice for a NOLA hotel, but would consider it again if I had to.Glad you had a great time overall here with us at Aloft NOLA. We appreciate your feedback and are always looking for ways to improve. Like most Aloft's, our breakfast options are grab and go items aimed at quick and convenient service. On a brighter note, those corner rooms are great and offer fantastic views on the Crescent City. We appreciate your business and look forward to having you back here with us again soon.Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager	4.0
The hotel staff was fabulous. I dealt with Franklin and India, and was very pleased with their service. The room could have been a bit cleaner, and the pool and area also needed a good cleaning, but overall the hotel was in good condition.	4.0
IF your looking for an affordable place close to DC this is the perfect place. It was convenient with 2 children to have a kitchen and a little extra room. The hotel offers a shuttle to the metro station but we found the walk to be pleasant and only 10 minutes away. There aren't any restaurants nearby so you either have to plan in advance or order food to be delivered. Another added benefit is the free parking, and plenty of it. I would probably stay again, if only for the location.	3.0
Bathroom disproportionately small compared to the rest of the room Hot breakfast of scrambled eggs and patties left a lot to be desired The theme park shuttle service was a disappointment only a handful of departures a day at not at all convenient times. We only took the shuttle once had to use Uber the rest of the time which was a pity cos I booked this hotel based on the free shuttle service to theme parks marketing Beds were huge and comfy Very friendly and helpful staff Location was good for access to Disney theme parks	4.0
Great hotel off the I-77 corridor for weary travelers. Was offered holiday special cheaper than the AAA rate. Wonderful desk person Tatiana was super helpful.

The overall ambience at this hotel was outstanding. The rooms were well supplied and the entire facility was clean and cheerful - but what made our stay at this facility so pleasant was the staff.

Bad: Nothing so far. Good: Perfect location to see the city. The hotel is comfortable, clean and spacious and excellent value for money. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.	5.0
We had a good stay at the Lincoln Plaza Hotel. The hotel decor is a bit outdated, so it was kind of like stepping back into the 1980's. But everything else was just fine about our stay. The check-in process was quick and easy. The staff was friendly. Our room was clean and comfortable. There is a refrigerator in the room for keeping items chilled. There was a coffee maker, as well, with both tea and coffee. The bathroom was small, but everything worked just fine. We needed extra towels and a visit to the front desk to ask for them had the towels delivered to our room in about five minutes. The hotel is located in the middle of Monterey Park, which is a majority Asian populated city. If you have an issue with being served by Asian staff, surrounded by Asian guests, and having people in your hotel speak a different language with each other when they are not speaking with you, then you might have issues staying at this hotel. But if you would like a clean, comfortable, budget-friendly place to stay when in the Los Angeles Area, the Lincoln Plaza Hotel should work nicely for you.	3.0
Good hotel for a one night stay	4.0
The rooms were fairly loud and the bed were just okay. There also was not a lot of restaurants around that were open past 10 so if you like to eat late like us it might be an issue. Great breakfast with lots of variety. Nice to have the shuttle even though there were limited times. We took it when we could other wise just used uber which was not really a problem for us. The room also had a little fridge and microwave which was great for storing and having snacks.	4.0
I was trying to save money when I booked a room here for three nights. The only good thing I can say is it was inexpensive. The bathroom sink was literally falling off the wall.

This was our first stay in a Drury property. After check in, we requested to switch rooms, as we were on the first floor, which was a bit noisy.

The website pictures of the hotel are very deceitful and does not match the actual product when one stays in the room. The pictures are misleading. The staff was rude and indifferent.

I was recently in Denver for a business conference. Our group had blocked a section of rooms for our stay. I was pleasantly surprised! The staff was very friendly and welcoming.

This morning I called to inquire about the availability for a five night stay wanting to give this property another chance from a previous unpleasant experience.

My stay was short...wished I could have stayed longer. Check in was fast. Staff very professional. Hotel was clean and inviting. Suite was spacious for a high rise Hotel. Expected cramped however, was pleasently surprised by it's size. Restaurant and convenience stores within walking distance. The Hotel is in a residential neighborhood, not much activity surrounding it. Although there is a fee for parking, It was the cheapest in the area.	5.0

Picked this hotel because it was advertised as the host hotel for a dog show/obedience trial. Since dogs have to be taken out regularly, attendees of course wanted rooms on the ground floor.

I needed an affordable hotel close to Fort Story. The Hampton Inn was perfect. The bed was very comfortable. The toiletries in the bathroom were of high quality, Neutrogena. anytime we needed anything (extra towels, paper plates for the pizza we had delivered, etc.) the staff was quick to help us. And having a hot breakfast with lots of options was great, too. There is an outdoor pool, but I did not use it. There is also a small workout room with a treadmill, an elliptical trainer, and a stationary bike, as well as weights. The neighborhood is very quiet, with a 7-11, Ruby Tuesday's, and a Rite Aid within walking distance. Freeway access was also very easy from there.	5.0
I stayed here the weekend of September 25th and had a relaxing stay. The location is a little odd but otherwise I have no complaints. It's close to the mall and numerous restaurants, overall a reasonable stay.	4.0
The hotel staff is always friendly and courteous. The elevator on the far side of the building seemed to be slow and not working at times, but there are two sets of stairs and one always working elevator so I really can't complain too much.	4.0

Very nice, clean hotel. The staff was very friendly. However, the room was very warm and even though I adjusted the thermostat it was still too warm. The windows will open a couple of inches which helped. It was 17 degrees outside and 85 inside. So, it didn't take too long to cool the room temperature down. The breakfast was good. They actually have real eggs and you can get them cooked to order.	5.0
This hotel met all my standards: First foremost, it was clean. Secondly, the bed was comfortable. Shower looked new and had some nice features, in addition to having a modern shower head. Along that line, the room entire hotel was modern/refurbished. Good wifi reception.	5.0
This hotel was really great! I had read many reviews of hotels in the area before booking, and this one was a winner in most categories and I can see why! The room was excellent, very clean, very modern, very nice. The only reason I went down on the comfort was that I found the bed to be a little hard for my liking, but I have back issues, so that could be why. The staff was amazing. I ended up becoming very ill, and they were very accommodating and empathetic, and that was greatly appreciated. The breakfast was excellent, a good spread with many options. The pool and hot tub were nice, especially in the evening. The location is directly on the beach, and the balconies allow for a fantastic view (even when you are lying ill on the couch!). I would most definitely stay here again, and it was an excellent price, making it that much better!	5.0
Quirky but clean and comfortable. No it's not a five star but resort but it doesn't pretend that it is, it's actually better because it has character and fits in perfectly with the Folly scene (which is quickly disappearing).	4.0

Close to all the action but off the main stretch so it's more peaceful. Near to lots of shops. There was an issue with our room and we had to spend one night in their sister hotel. The staff couldn't have been more helpful to make sure we were comfortable. The hotel offers a portable wifi hotspot for guests to take out with them - very cool!	4.0

Fantastic housekeeping service, comfy beds, free parking, free cookies, coffee and lemonade in the lobby most of the day, free breakfast BUT the BEST part is the proximity to the park!

We hadn't visited the St. Regis Hotel in New York before, and I'll admit to having been a little wary. There are certain Grande Dame hotels in the Starwood portfolio that are a little past their shelf life, and looking a bit beaten up and in need of TLC. Not so the incredibly beautiful and fastidiously maintained St. Regis New York. This is a hotel that literally glistens with fresh paint, fresh scrubbing, fresh upholstery, sparkling crystal, and obsessive attention paid to every detail down to the weight of the stationery and the bulbs in the light fixtures. The desk staff was immediately friendly and accommodating. We asked for an SPG upgrade and were prepared for the usual few added square feet or better view. What we were given was the Fifth Avenue Suite, a truly grand and beautiful collection of rooms, palatial by Manhattan apartment standards, with a view of Fifth Avenue below. Like the rest of the hotel, the room was spotless, freshly refurbished, and offered two bathrooms, a generous walk-in closet, a fridge, and a host of creature comforts. Couldn't have asked for better.The Concierge staff were on their game and steered us to some terrific smaller restaurants we hadn't visited before. Every phone call to room service, the front desk, and housekeeping was met with a thoughtful, friendly, and always helpful voice at the other end. This is one of those hotels that reflects well on its demanding management and training standards, and every employee we met was professional and incredibly helpful and friendly. And every last one seemed aware and proud of the hotel's origins, history, and ambition to be the best at what it does.Minor gripes: Certain rooms in the hotel offer Butler Service, a tradition and pride of the St. Regis since its opening in 1904. We found the service a little awkward to use. When you phone the Butler, you hear a tone then a shrill whistle on the phone similar to reaching a fax machine. We weren't sure what this was about, so we phoned the hotel operator who said this was the paging system for the butlers, but she'd make sure our request for coffee service got through. A short while later, the Butler did arrive with coffee, and was very helpful with a few other requests. But we're not sure he'd have shown if not for the operator, because the next day we put in two calls, and after waiting for over an hour for any response, we just gave up and used other services. We also found, that for a hotel that paid such attention to detail in other areas, the door staff was not its strong suit. At great hotels, the doormen are part of the guest's first impression, with a greeting, an opened door, and an offer of help. The staff, at least on our visit, were often sort of just standing around, in one case watching us lug a heavy bag up the stairs before finally offering some help with the second. No one greeted us or opened a door on our several trips in and out, and we were just a little surprised at this minor lapse in an otherwise fantastic experience.The King Cole bar is cozy, classically New York, and historic-feeling. The Astor Court restaurant is beautiful and relaxed the food a little hit-and-miss. Likewise, the Private Dining options vary from delicious to just okay. Again, these are relatively minor complaints and smallish pieces of what was, overall, perhaps the best hotel experience we've had in the U.S. or Europe. Congratulations to everyone at the St. Regis for maintaining this fantastic and important heritage property.Dear twinlions, We are very pleased to learn that so many associates provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York.Thank you for your time, and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests. Also, thank you for the constructive feed-back regarding front service and butlers. Rest assured, it will be addressed. We will share your kind words with our teams and we are so grateful for your support!We hope that we will have the opportunity of having you as our guest very soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager	5.0

We were blown away at the dcor and style of this Courtyard Marriott! We were finishing our vacation week which was split between Myrtle and Charleston SC and we had just been very disappointed by our stay in Charleston at the Hyatt Place. This was just what we needed to turn things around! We were going to a show at the House of Blues and it was perfect, just down the street! Plenty of gas, mini golf, food, bars, shopping etc nearby! We arrived early and they did not have rooms ready so they gave us free waters and snacks and although we maybe waited 30 mins for a room they kept checking on us as well as still got us into a room before the posted check in time on 4th of July weekend! I would highly recommend this hotel!!	5.0

Good hotel, great location, but needs a few improvements. No porter service, despite a somewhat awkward parking/luggage unloading situation that makes checking in/out difficult for handicapped/elderly.

We stayed at this hotel for the St Patrick's Day Dash in Seattle due to its location. It is a nice hotel, right across the Space Needle. We stayed in a suite... it actually had a full kitchen! Including dishwasher, microwave, garbage disposal, etc... Perfect for a family staying for a few days. Our room was facing other rooms, so when you open your blinds, you will see all the other rooms... kinda creppy, so beware and request a room facing out to the street.The hotel server a hot breakfast and it was actually pretty good. Supervised me how good it was, I even went back for seconds. Hotel has parking... but spaces are very limited and very small.... so leave the Ford350 at home.All in all... excellent hotel and an excellent location.FMH60878,Thank you for taking the time to submit such pleasant comments about us at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown.

They have a great sandwich shop at the shell station on the corner open until 2 am which is a bonus and saved us a ton of on food. Also a little hole in the wall casino bar where you can get a beer and all beef hot dog for 3, shots for 4 just down the street.	4.0
The room, the beds, the food and the help at this hotel is nothing short of perfect without including a lot of extras my husband and I don't need. The location is close to everything and the building is historical and very well kept. Could not ask for a more homey place to stay.	5.0
We had a reservation last month. On our way to this hotel, my daughter got sick in the car. And we made the choice to return home and cancel our vacation (we had Sesame Place and Dutch Wonderland in mind). We called Comfort Inn and explained our situation.

The room was so noisy we could hear every footstep from the people above, every toilet flush and every shower that they took. Winetasting in the courtyard was very loud and folks stayed after the winetasting drinking until the wee hours of the night . Staff was not willing to quiet them nor even leave the front desk to talk to them. Breakfast items in the morning were not replenished hot water was out replaced with warm water not useful at all . Rumors of free vouchers to Dennys never appeared .This was not a cheap property I do not feel I got my moneys worth I couldve stayed at a motel eight or six for equivalent valueOn behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future.	2.0
The staff are very helpful and friendly and the rooms, large, clean and well appointed. We had nice linens too. Breakfast was fine - muffins, bagels pastries, toast, hard boiled eggs, juices cereals etc. Very good price point.

This resort is GORGEOUS!! Check in was perfect our room wasnt ready (we were there early) so they took my phone number while we had drinks by the pool and in 20 mins or so our room was ready!

One elevator for this large 10 story hotel was not good. Also all the hallways and elevator were extremely muggy and hot. When we arrived we had to park in the far extra parking lot and carry all of our luggage I. The pouring rain bc they allowed bikers to park under the entire awning unload rock. Very dissapointed in that lack of customer service. Other than that we had a beautiful room with very comfortable beds and a great view.	4.0
I got a great rate at this hotel. If I was staying in the area again, I would spend the night at this hotel. I'm sure i'll be back! This hotel gives great service and a great room.	5.0
Would be nice if the duvet were in a duvet cover as I just get tangled between the flat sheets and the comforter Gym could really do with some more variety in terms of machinery - Its impossible to do much leg work as there is no squat rack with a bar - or even a smith machine which has multiple purposes Super helpful staff 24/7 - very accommodating of my unusual hours Room service menu is amazing Views are amazing Cerise Bar on the roof is epic and the bartenders are amazing I will be coming back and SOON!	5.0
Bad: What I didnt like is the service of the staff. I reserved and paid last October a city view room, check in online on our way to the hotel and was assured key is waiting. But when we got there, no room available for city view. We were settled for a night in 3rd floor and we were assured the next 5nights we will be in the 6th floor. But the following day, they gave us a floor higher only, 4th floor. We cant see much of the city from 4th floor. All we can see is adjacent buildings. We were frustrated that there is no cafeteria for breakfast. Yeah, breakfast is included on the price but no chair to sit on, no table use. It is a grab and go breakfast. Very incovenient because breakfast is served in 5th and 6th floors's console table only. No microwave, no toaster. How can you eat the bagels they served in very cold temperature Secondly, we were not given instructions / info on our check in at the hotel what are the facilities they have for us. We only discovered while we were staying at the hotel. Like business center, fitness center,etc. The housekeeping, bad service! They forgot to replace the complimentary k-cup coffee. One day, they left a used pair of socks in our room. A pair of black socks rolled,dirty for a man whose size could be for a 6 footer and taller. My boys are only 5'3. Next day, they left again a wet soiled pink shirt on the table where the TV is. Why is that Everyday I always left as tip and a way of thank you for cleaning the room but all they leave is mess. Good: I like the location of this hotel. Very accessible to everything,from all kinds of food/resto to tourist attractions.	3.0
This is one of the newest hotels in Key West. It's located in the new section of town and is about a 15 minute car ride to Duval St. The rooms and facilities are modern. The customer service was variable and I was disappointed with their lack of assistance when we encountered an issue with our air conditioner. Parking is free, wifi is decent and free, there is also a free breakfast which was nice. Best of all, no resort fee. Dear netgeek,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We take all of our reviews seriously so that we can better serve our guests. I apologize for that lack of assistance regarding your air conditioner, and I will be getting with my staff so that they better assist our guests better when they are having issues with our hotel. I hope that you will return so that next time we can better serve you.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager	4.0

We stay here every time we're in Cambridge. It's just a stone's throw from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, so the location is perfect.

The staff was extremely accommodating whenever we needed. The room was clean and pleasant. The location was within walking distance to several great venues. Not having been in Atlanta before we had a hard time locating the entrance for checking in however.	4.0
Bad: The bathroom toilet area is tight. Would not probably be comfortable for larger person. You can hear through walls bit isn't much of an issue as probably will not be in room most of time. Good: Great location to beach and bars/restaurants. Convenient beach service as related to provided towel, chair, and umbrella service. Very good happy hour prices as related to that areas prices.	5.0
The hotel staff was friendly and helpful at any hour of the day or night. Food was hot and freshly prepared. The only down-side was the fire alarms went off 3 of the 4 nights we were there - twice with cause and once accidentally. The shuttle service is a great plus and staff willingly took us to/from the Metro station every day. Even though the location seems a little far from downtown DC, it's extremely convenient to the Metro and other amenities in the neighborhood. For a mid-range hotel, it's quite comfortable. Extra kudos to Stacey :-)	5.0
The room was clean with appealing color palette. The downtown location was in close proximity to restaurants, etc. The valets were prompt and courteous. The staff was most hospitable. Would recommend to those traveling in Minneapolis!	4.0
I was excited to find this place for a road trip down the Oregon coast, since it had such great reviews from other travelers. Unfortunately, it was a bit of a disappointment.

The staff at this Comfort Inn is wonderful. They are always very accommodating with us and help us out. We've stayed here more than once but always in room 201. It's a very nice room, it's clean, and the beds are comfortable. The included breakfast is quite good for a free breakfast and my nieces love the waffles! My nieces also love their pool! It's pretty average size for a hotel but big enough for us. Marzoni's is just across the parking lot which is great for us because it is our favorite restaurant in the Altoona area.	4.0
Filthy outside grounds with construction debris, cat litter, plastic bags, and garbage. Inside lobby was under construction breakfast was in a storage room with no place to eat.

As a frequent guest at the Aria, our most recent trip was almost as expected. The property in general is outstanding for it's facilities and its location on the strip.

I have been to the Charles several times over the last 20 years. Some parts of the hotel are consistent over the years: the rooms are clean and the staff is professional.

overnight in walking distance of subway , parks and downtown. Staff was very helpful. Good value for the money	5.0
The hotel was lovely and the staff was great...very helpful with directons around the city. My husband, our adult daughter stayed here for the weekend. The only complaint is that the bed needs to be replaced and the sleep sofa was very short even when fully opened. The bed was very soft which caused us to roll toward the middle. The rooom was very clean and nicely appointed with a good sized flat screen TV. The AC worked well. The best part of this hotel is that if you plan to stay more than a few days, the room comes with a small kitchen that has the basics...dishes, pots, pans,etc. and a dishwasher.	4.0
Staff was pleasant. Breakfast was a little better than average. They had waffles, eggs,sausage, fruit and the usual pastries. Our room was old, smelled of cigarette smoke. Water damage, loose fixtures in the bathroom. Was supposed to stay 4 nights but found better accommodations after 2.	2.0
Traveling on a budget and this fit the bill perfectly. The Dillon Motel has a lot of character, is in a marvelously central location and Mr. James is a great host.

This was a very nice hotel. Great location. Staff nice and professional. One stood out for me and was very helpful and fair. Her name is Sarah- Sarah Smile. She upgraded my room due to my room was not ready after the check in time. She was also so helpful with telling us where we could walk to for a great meal. We were able to walk to the Casino, Bourbon Street, Canal Street, etc- it is really a great little hotel in a perfect location. Oh yeah, the roof- we thoroughly enjoyed. Nice mingle spot! Good drinks and food! Don't slip- I heard about and purchased thru Hotwire as not known until I paid for it- great choice-but will book direct next time. I do recommend to your review readers and I will stay there again.Thank you for the wonderful review and recognizing the efforts of our hard working team here at The Troubadour.

I'll start this review by saying that Honua Kai is not a Hotel or a Resort. It's amazing that they charge a 25.00 resort fee, because this place is merely a Condominium Complex. I've read the numerous other reviews on this place, and most of them are spot on. The rooms are nice, because they are new, but everything else... More	2.0

The location is great, about 10 minutes' walk from Rosslyn Metro. Environment good too. The only thing I dislike is the check in time. Their standard check-in time is 3:00pm, but we actually cannot check-in until 3:40pm. Hotel staff kept telling us it would be 20 or 10 more minutes, but we waited from 1:00pm until 3:40pm. Not a good experience. The room and corridor had cigarette smell, even though we selected Smoke Free room. The blank has a big cut on it. House cleaning lady sometimes left a piece of paper on the floor even though we left 2 dollars as tip. Guess she might not be satified with us. Overall, the place is not a bad selection. I vote for the location and price.	3.0
We arrived pretty early, before normal check in. The front desk did not hesitate to try to find us a room as soon as possible.

We had a corner suite on the 8th floor this past weekend and were pleasantly surprised by the large size of the room and bathroom. Upon check-in, we were told that the pool and roof bar were on the 9th floor. We had concerns about possible noise only being one floor down, but our stay was very quiet throughout the weekend. Pluses:The room was very clean and nicely furnished. Customer service was excellent. We called the front desk to request a fridge for medication and it was delivered within 5 minutes. We also saw a couple gift items in the gift store early on Sunday morning before our flight out but the shop had not opened yet. The manager was kind enough to open the store for us an hour beforehand so that we could make our purchases. The hotel is only a short 5-10 mins walk from the French Quarter. High quality, soft toilet paper and high quality toiletries and linens provided. Nice brushed nickel finishes in the bathroom. Complimentary water in the room.Minor Issues:King-sized bed was a bit lumpy and sagged except for the middle. We would have preferred a smoother, firmer mattress. The power buttons and volume buttons on both remote controls for the TVs did not function. The next day, we finally found the joystick button on the bottom middle frame of each TV to control the volume and power. We did not use the pool, but it is very small.We are delighted you enjoyed your time at NOPSI. Let us know when you are travelling back to NOLA and we will ensure your stay is most memorable.

Our first impression was that the hotel was just run down. Our room had broken furniture, disintegrating drywall and wood, an air conditioner that left a growing shopping wet puddle and beds a pillows that no one would find comfortable. The continental breakfast consisted of slices of bread, waffles, bagels, fruit loops and apples. To bad for you if you are gluten intolerant or just want some protein for breakfast. The free shuttle only picked up twice a day and would leave on our before the scheduled time so you had better be there early. You still might not get on, because it's just a large van and they had to call a second shuttle for you to wait for. The hotel staff could be rude and curt or helpful and curt, it's a roulette. By the end of our stay the maids didn't seem to care. They just threw the covers on no matter what was under them and didn't bother to clean. Since it's just a place to lay down after the amusement parks I guess if serves is purpose.	2.0
Good: The wifi connection in my room was loose and disconnected during the Inauguration weekend. But the nightclerk (red-haired Irish lass) tried very hard to fix it for me. In the morning William 3 came in and tried to fix it.	5.0

Bad: Breakfast was not included and in my opinion too expensive, especially for guests of your hotel. They told us it was a buffet and 15 per person. We didn't even check it out at that point.

Most probably I would give it a excellent review if it was not for the service obtained on Saturday. Sam (shuttle driver), Ester, Ana (Bar attendants) and front desk personnel for Thursday and Friday gave us a 5 star service. Everything went down to the drain Saturday afternoon had to wait for over an hour at the train station driver and front desk attendant blamed each other. I put it behind and most definitely I would stay again good breakfast, good service overall, location, rooms are kept clean.	4.0

This hotel is a bit of a ride on the metro if you are going to DC but the facilities and staff are excellent. Great place for families with kids and an amazing breakfast.

Let me say upfront that this could have been a 4 star resort. Gave it three due to the treatment we received upon arrival.

My family and I stayed here for the weekend to do the Across the Bay 10k events. The hotel is older and the condition shows it. Furniture and carpet show many signs of wear and tear. The pool was not open because it was November. The front desk was very friendly and helpful when we called down or stopped to ask questions. Maid service did an excellent job of cleaning, making the beds, and giving us fresh bath supplies. Breakfast was very yummy with many different options. There is a grocery store, gas station, and place to eat all within walking distance. The neighborhood didn't seem the best at night so we stayed in the room when it got late. The room doors are all on the outside of the building which I really don't care for due to safety. Overall not terrible but you get what you pay for and I was trying to save a few dollars.	2.0
Very nicely decorated and furnished hotel, great location, friendly staff. Attentive door staff (valet or self-parking).

Bad: We had a really rude man greet us at the check in counter. When my dad didn't understand what he was asking he gave him such an attitude. Everything else was perfect except for that encounter.	5.0
Bad: Hot tub was very dirty, needed a good wash down and no in house restraunt. The station 10 grill associated with property was good but not located within hotel. Good: We liked the location of the hotel to the activities going on for the week we traveled and it's easy access to beach and boardwalk, breakfast was really good, but gotta get up early to avoid long lines.	4.0
Nice hotel in SLO. staff was friendly and they had cookies and coffee when we checked in. Only minor complaint was the continental breakfast was a little on the light side. But there are plenty of places to eat in SLO so other than that it was great.	5.0
Stayed here for one night while in town to see a show. As noted, the staff was very friendly. Even though I wouldn't call it a wine tasting, the little happy hour they provide is unique and a cute amenity. Our room was small, but that was expected. Plus, it was clean. More than anything, free Wi-Fi is always a... More	5.0
Totally recommend this hotel to anyone Staff extremely helpful. Deshia is a exceptional employee. Went out of her way to make sure everything was satisfactory. If in vallego again I would definitely stay at Best Western Inn and Suites at Dscovery Kingdom, Vallego	5.0
Bad: Had a couple of glitches getting the room serviced but otherwise very friendly and helpful staff. Good: Great location. Nice rooms with exceptionally comfortable bed.	4.0
We stayed overnight before catching a flight out. The hotel was much nicer than we expected, the staff was friendly and our room had a living area and small kitchenette. The rooms were well insulated from noise. They had a nice happy hour (free drinks for guests from 5-7) and a MADE TO ORDER complimentary breakfast that were both great. I would not recommend the steakhouse located in the building. The food was decent, but overpriced and lacking in quality. The hotel also has a shuttle leaving for the airport every half hour. It made for a really nice stay for two weary travelers.	4.0
Stayed in this hotel last week. The manager and staff were very nice and friendly. The room was clean (even behind stuff), the bed was comfortable, and it was quiet. The hotel offered lots of extras for free such as free hot breakfast, drinks in the evening, hot dinner, and long distance calls. While the food was bland and tastelss, it was there for anyone that did not want to go out for decent tasting food. The bartender poured good drinks and it was a good opportunity to meet some of the other hotel guests and the hotel staff. The manager made it a point to stop at tables and talk to guests and get to know them. All-in-all it was an excellent stay and very good value! The only item that could be considered a complaint was that even with the heat off my room was hot. I had to turn the AC on to get a comfortable temp.	5.0
Once again we were treated to pure luxury at the Bardessono. Welcomed with Family Hill wine, an in room massage and comfortable surroundings, our 3rd stay was exceptional.

We booked a wedding block for a group attending a near-by celebration. (Thank goodness the hotel wasn't the wedding venue). From check-in to check out, the experience was a fiasco.

Originally this hotel was booked because I had to take a recertification exam at a location 2 exits south. It was meant to give me a couple of days to get away, do a final review and get me closer to the testing center on exam day. I called the front desk to let them know my need for a... More	5.0
The place is a complete dump! The rooms are super small and cramped. They don't care about their customers and house keeping could do a way better job on the cleanliness of the rooms. There's not enough parking and the chance of your vehicle getting hit by another is highly possible. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone staying... More	1.0

My sister and I stayed at the HotelRED while a family member was in a local hospital. We found the hotel to be an oasis in our otherwise very stressful days.

Terrible. I spent my last penny reserving my room and i didn't see anything about a deposit under the small print tab, so I thought I was all paid up. Suddenly, after having spent nearly half an hour checking-in with their highly unprofessional staff just before I was given my keys so I could go find my room, the room keys didn't work on my room. So I walked all the way to the lobby, this time with my bags in tow, only to find out that they deactivated my room keys because they weren't able to charge card for incidentals. Which is when I said, of course not...I spent my last penny reserving this place online and there was no mention of a deposit in your 'small print' tab online. Every room I've reserved through Hotels.com, that has charged me a deposit, mentioned a deposit or incidentals charge in their small tab. Well I cancelled my reservation and asked for my money back so I could rent another room elsewhere. The manager cancelled my reservation and stated that he would be refunding my money, but he never did. I was not able to rent another room...I was broke.	1.0
Bad: The breakfast could have had more protein options. Good: Loved the room and the location	5.0
The hotel itself was fine--accommodating and clean, and the room was spacious. I found the bed, however (a SleepNumber bed) very uncomfortable and couldn't manage to change the preset number. The restaurant was just so-so. The food wasn't very tasty. On the night we checked in I had a grilled chicken sandwich with roasted peppers and pesto that I thought would be really good--the sandwich was heavy on the roasted peppers but the pesto was almost non-existent. The following morning we had the buffet breakfast. It was a wonderful spread--fruits, cereal, eggs, potatoes, sausages, french toast sticks--but the pastries and french toast were stale and the eggs seemed very bland. On the plus side the waiter said that if we didn't want scrambled eggs we could have eggs made to order (we hadn't complained, he simply offered that). So I'm fine with the hotel in general (I admit the bed problem may be mine alone), but wish the restaurant was as good as the bed.	4.0
the hotel was beautiful! the staff friendly but the room was missing a few amenities such as no cream or sugar for coffee. Bell man left me in the hotel lobby with a full cart, 2 kids and a small dog in crate, after i had tipped him to take me upstairs. I had to manage by myself. Manager was very nice and gave us a comp breakfast buffet.	2.0
We got a free upgrade to a room with a jacuzi. It was right in the middle of the bed room... too funny! The beds where fine, the staff was great but the view from the top deck during breakfast....breathtaking!!!! I would go back in a heartbeat!	5.0
This all hotel is very nice for this area of Hmpton Inns and Courtyards, but they dont deserve the class boutique they give themselves.

Our extended family (6 adults and 3 kids) stayed in the Cunningham Suite (3 bedrooms + pull out couch and full kitchen).

This hotel will never be considered luxurious, BUT the charm, staff, and grounds make up for it. The rooms are comfortable and very functional. Close walk to old cocoa village, with great restaurants all within walking distance. I am local but still go out of my way to stay there!	4.0
Nice place to stay. Very quiet. Even with outside temps around 40's the pool area was in the 70's and water was relaxing. and of course those late evening cookies are a nice touch as well. Breakfast was always ready at 6:00 and also has those Breakfasts To-Go-Bags if youre in a hurry.	5.0
The property is very nice and well cared for on a daily basis. Complimentary breakfast very good. Staff very friendly. They are rated by AAA. Property to walk around.

You have to be prepared for anything at a hotel within this price range, but I was surprised to find that it was clean and decently maintained. The price was right for me, so I think overall it was worth it. I stayed there on a Friday night and didn't notice any loud people or drunks in the area.	4.0
After a long drive it was nice to come to a nice, comfortable hotel and a quiet one.	5.0
I visited my old neighborhood for a few days. The clerk recognized me from a previous stay when I checked in. Hotel personnel called a cab twice, with a rapid response. The computer in the business center wasn't working, so they printed my boarding pass at the front desk.	5.0
I coordinated a group of 23 visiting Napa during the grape harvest in October, and we booked the entire group into the Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines. First, let me say if youre a snob and really into posh places with fancy marble lobby floors, fluffy robes on the hook, perky concierge behind a big desk, etc. this may not be for you. But if you like to get real value, service and comfortable accommodations for a modest price, you cannot beat the Inn at the Vines. It is family owned and operated (several generations), and the service and sense of community are notable in this day and age. The place has been updated and has all the features you need..clean well furnished rooms, flat screens, very comfortable beds (we had king bed rooms), great towels, and organic soaps. To some earlier reviews about highway noise: we found it minimal and no one in our group complained. Yes, I did hear the occasional truck early in the morning or California kid with a Flowmaster exhaust doing a jack-rabbit start from the intersectionagain it was not a problem. Ask for a room in the back of the hotel. Front Desk Manager Shanirra did an exceptional job booking our customized winery tour, restaurant reservations, and balloon rides. As our person on the ground in Napa she was in our corner every step of the way and played a large part of a successful three days in Napa! At the front desk Melody, Shawn and Bertha were always helpful, upbeat and service-minded. Complimentary hotel breakfasts are a joke at many hotels.not so at the Inn at the Vines. There is a Dennys on the property, and you get a legitimate complimentary hot breakfast at the restaurant not some dinky room off the lobby. Try eggs any way you want, bacon/sausage and pancakes/toast and coffee. You cant beat it unless you must have Eggs Benedict and mimosas. The owners are continuously making improvements to keep up with newer hotels. During out stay a fitness center and business center were under construction. Botom line: when visiting Napa in the future I will stay at the Inn at the Vines again. Our entire group was pleased.Ed,it was a pleasure meeting you and hosting your group for your stay in the Napa Valley. I enjoyed hearing your story of what happened at the Castle. Yes, Shanirra is a great employee who is always the first to try out new restaurants and tours. All of our employees keep up to date on all there is to do in the Valley. We are family run (4th generation), and as you saw, we take pride in our Hotel. I am glad your group enjoyed their stay and maybe we can make this an annual event.	5.0
We were looking for a quiet retreat and we found it! Our suite had a partial waterfront view that was sublime! The decor was wonderful, and we enjoyed cooking for ourselves, although we did treat ourselves to their fabulous restaurant! We even stayed an extra day! This was our best stay in Virginia Beach, and we will be back soon!!	5.0

The hotel was decent but the room did not seem cleaned thoroughly. There was hair from a previous guest in the shower which I did not notice until I went to shower in the morning. The bed comforter seemed a little dirty as well. The bar closes at 10pm which seemed a little early. The staff was very friendly.	3.0
Was in Miami for a work trip and stayed here for four nights. Overall clean hotel with better than average customer service.

After arriving at the train stop having taken the train from the Baltimore airport, I called the hotel for the shuttle to pick me up. There was no signage for where the pickup was to meet the shuttle. Unfortunately, I didn't listen carefully to the description of where the pick up would be, so I assumed it was on the opposite side of the train tracks, and I missed it. Moral of the story: don't assume you know where the shuttle bus will pick you up. After that, The shuttle worked very well. In the room, the bathroom smelled funky and the air conditioning unit was noisy. The breakfast was very good, and the staff was friendly.	4.0

Como otras veces en este hotel. Tranquila y comoda, a pesar de la lejania y largo viaje en metro.

Overnight business stay. Brand new Hotel. Neat and clean. Friendly staff. This is the 3rd Hyatt Place I have stayed since November, and the concept just works well for me.

My wife and I recently moved to Vegas, and come here fairly regularly. We recently visited Salvatore's Italian restaurant for our anniversary dinner.

The room was good and on the opposite side of the highway and low (2nd floor) as we heard others say something about the highway noise. The breakfast and shuttle saved us a ton of money and time. The hot breakfast (eggs, waffles, grits, oatmeal, etc.) is the same everyday but there is enough of a variety if you stay long it won't get boring. The shuttle will take you within 3 miles and the DC Metro station is within this range. They start at 6:30 am if you wan to get an early start but they had 3 different vans so we had no wait anytime we wanted to leave. Short wait when you called for pick-up but not long. No parking hassles in DC (15+ a day or at the Metro station (5 a day). It was hot (100+) so the pool was a great way to cool off after walking all day around DC.	5.0
We stayed here for a sports tournament recently. Compared to the experience of families who stayed at nearby hotels, our stay was fine.

My daughter is a student at Virginia Tech, we had traveled down to attend farm day. The hotel is close, clean, good breakfast (except the eggs, they taste weird).

Carmel Valley is a pricey place, but the Blue Sky Lodge is a reasonable accommodation right in the main bit of town. It's a bit old, and the rooms look ridiculously low rent from the outside (think beach bathrooms) but on the inside they're not bad at all. The balconies are wonderful, and the optional little kitchenette is useful. The pool and hot tub are a great distraction (do say hello to Molly the pool dog).	4.0

If you're looking for a motel to spend a night at cheap it is a fairly good deal. The room was clean, but it had a slight order. Tthe bed covering had some burn holes and tears. The eating area is somewhat small and breakfast selection was very basic. The bottom line: If this is a stop off on the way from point A to point B and you want to save some money for your vacation you might give it a try.

I did like this hotel but found the room quite small it was listed as Suites but was smaller than most regular Inns. They had the most helpful people of our whole trip every one was friendly and helpful. We visited the DDay Memorial while here it was a very moving sight.	4.0
The Found:RE is a great new hotel in Phoenix. My co-worker and I had such a good experience there. It was a perfect location. Staff were amazing, and very helpful. Even though they were still renovating certain areas (hotel has only been open for 2 weeks) it was an all around great place to stay. Thank you for your understanding while we are still putting the final touches on things. We're so happy to hear our Curators were able to make your stay more enjoyable. Please come back and see us again!	4.0
When I looked at the pictures , I thought that I have an excellent deal at hand but it turned out to be a total let down ...This hotel is not even worth comparing to a MOTEL6 or SUPER8 . It is run down and shabby . Will not stay here ever.	2.0
We have stayed at this hotel several other times and it has not improved. There are not many in the area and a football game at Penn State that weekend filled those up and raised the price quickly. This hotel is old, run down and lacks many amenities, but we slept there only and were gone during the days for... More	2.0
We drove 17 hours that day and I just wanted to shower and sleep. I am so glad they open this newer hotel in Deming. Breakfast was pretty good but the rooms were great. We will be back next time we come through NM.	5.0
This hotel was clean, staff was friendly, and beds were comfortable. The ONLY warning I will give is to those couples looking for a romantic getaway in Napa. One of the selling points (in my opinion) on their site was the comfortable outdoor seating area with a beautiful fireplace. If there are private parties booked that area won't be available to you until 10 p.m. We were disappointed and unaware of this as our hotel had private parties every night we were there.	3.0
This is the 6th time we have stayed at WW. This stay was for 2 wks and we are well pleased. The setting is magnificent and the staff so very helpful. many thanks to Rose for all the personal assistance she gave us. The movie selection is great and Sundae night is fun	5.0
I was expecting a suite considering the name of the hotel but it was really a standard room. I overlooked that as I should have paid better attention but the room was not very clean. I found a dried up contact lense in our bed, there was mildew in the tub, and the room could have used a sweeping. The other issues we had was that when we returned from dinner the front desk worker was sitting on the couches with her significant other while there were children sitting at the hotel bar. Also later my husband ran out quickly to grab something from our car and this same hotel employee did not bother to look up from her phone when he entered the hotel. Last, I went to buy a snack and a drink later that evening, the same employee was on a clearly personal phone call did not even notice I was there. I seriously could have taken the stuff left and she would not have noticed. We have a returned visit to Baltimore and I don't think we will be staying here again.	2.0

First of all, the staff was very nice. However, I was very disappointed in this hotel. The rooms are supposed to be 100 percent smoke free, but the smoke smell hit the second I walked in the room. I called the front desk to ask to be transferred to another room but none were available. The front desk kindly offered... More	2.0
Staff was very nice and friendly, quick check in and check out, good variety offered for breakfast, good location. Only inconvenience on the weekend our family stayed there was a convention happening at the hotel on the Friday evening which made the lobby area were crowded and noisy.	5.0
Clean, very nice staff, comfy beds and pillows. Hot breakfast. A very nice place close to the airport and it has free shuttles. (Did not partake in that service). Everything in the room worked flawlessly.	5.0
Stayed here based on the reviews and can definitely see why it comes highly regarded. Well appointed rooms, great breakfast, and valet service was great! Solidly build old federal building so noise wasn't an issue and room was impeccably clean. It was a quick overnight stay but would definitely return if in the area!	5.0
We needed a hotel close to the Buffalo Airport as we had a flight booked early morning the following day. We choose Aloft Buffalo Airport on a whim as the photos and amenities seemed intriguing.

My wife loved the exterior from the moment she saw the house, and she liked our room as well. I think the older style of the house and rooms enhanced our stay in Amish country.

We stayed here for one night at the end of May. It was a last minute find and we got a great room, very clean, stylish. Amenities were great. Free wifi. Close to town. We would definitely return if we end up in Ojai again.	5.0
Our stay was perfect - from the moment we checked in. The staff were friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the happy hour - great selection of wine and snacks. The room was nice - NYC small but had everything we needed. The bathroom had everything - including bubble bath and toothpaste! Who does that We liked the neighborhood - haven't stayed in Chelsea before, but it was a great location. We cabbed it to Broadway for dinner and a show, but also did lots of walking - including up to the Natural History Museum. It was a short stay, but we can't wait to go back to the Maritime Hotel!	5.0

Loved this hotel. Charming, comfortable, impeccably clean, I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying downtown Charleston.	5.0
Bad: Please take heed to this warning do not stay here. My car along with 3 other guest cars staying at this hotel were broken into overnight. The hotel didnt try to make us feel more safe or accommodate us.. They do not care at all. If you are trying to save money dont chance it by staying here unless you want your car broken into and you want your property stolen. It's not worth it you are better off staying in another hotel. This ruined our trip and we didn't feel safe staying there and management doesnt care at all also.. There is no security gaurds or cameras on this property so ask yourself if you want to be next. .	1.0
The staff went above and beyond expectations. Always ready to help. The breakfast always had something everyone wanted to eat.

I stayed at the Virginian Suites for one night in February and I was overall impressed with the hotel. It's a little difficult to get to if you don't know the area, but it's very convenient to restaurants and Georgetown, it would probably be a nice walk in the spring/summer. I stayed in a studio suite and there was a full kitchen with dishes and cooking utensils and it was very clean. There was a flat screen tv and couch. (A bit uncomfortable though). The bed was comfortable with high quality sheets. The bathroom was clean, but a bit small. There is a lot of storage and a large closet, so it would be a good place to stay for an extended period of time. The staff was very attentive, and the Washington Post was delivered in the morning. The only complaints I have are that the internet password did not work (though I'm sure this could have been fixed had I bothered to call the front desk), the small bathroom, and the fact that you have to pay for parking (7 a night). Other than that, I definitey recommend this hotel!	4.0
This hotel was awesome the rooms were great the staff was awesome the location was perfect the only draw back to this hotel is the 40 for valet parking however there are other cheaper options close to the hotel the roof top bar was really cool the breakfast was excellent overall the hotel gets a 97 out of 100 score from meThank you so much for taking the time to share this great review of your stay and we are delighted to know how much you enjoyed our property and service provided. There are cheaper options of parking around the area which is due to them having less labor and security costs than ours but yes they are conveniently located should guests decide to utilize those options. Your business and feedback are very important to us and we look forward to having you stay with us again whenever your travels bring you back to New Orleans.Best regards,	5.0
A group of people from our Church get together for lunch/brunch once a month after morning worship. We love to come to Spoonbread but our December get-together is always a highlight.

Went to eat at their buffet. They have a variety of foods. Good food for a great price. If it's your first visit, you get a discount on the buffet. We also did a little bit of gambling. I was in town visiting family and they informed me of other things you can do such as bowl and catch a movie.	4.0

Palo Alto is an expensive area so finding someplace to stay that was reasonable was challenging. Comfort Inn offers a market-competitive value and a consistent stay.

Me and my husband decided to get away for a weekend and found this hotel online. It had everything we needed plus a mini-fridge and an lcd tv. The room was clean and comfortable. A very delightful stay. :)	4.0
Bad: I don't really know why this hotel has such a high rating. It's decent, but definitely not worth 3* and 300+ I paid for the room. Nothing in particular, but just the entire feel and look of it was more in the 2*, 150-200 range. Also, there were some road works taking place just outside the hotel at 7AM that produced insufferable noise, so I wish I had known that before booking.	3.0
I spent two days here on a business trip had never stayed in a Drury before. This was a very pleasant surprise.

Room and bathroom smelled like urine. Breakfast area was dirty, and food was handled with bare hands by attendant instead of using utensils. Overall hotel is severely run down, and in dire need of renovations and updates. At least the sheets were clean and the staff was friendly.	2.0
The pillows were too small and not comfortable. The staff was wonderful. The complimentary breakfast was very good.	5.0
Given the location of the hotel, it wasn't a bad stay. I know the name on the outside has changed a few times but the interior hasn't changed much at all.. The over night desk clerk mumbles when he speaks making my late night check-in that much more agonising. The maintenance housekeeping crew were overly polite and courteous, loved it. The front desk clerk and manager both over night and day shifts need to take a page from their fellow employees book on manners.	3.0

We stayed here one night while passing through town. The room was very clean, spacious but just a touch too costly at 131 a night. 100 for the family sized room is more realistic. Oh Well. Nothing really bad to say.I hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience.	4.0

The service was pretty awful. Check in took way too long - only one person at front desk who was extremely slow. Requested cab in AM and staff was unable to secure - got own Uber instead. Arrived back at hotel at 6PM last day of stay and room was being cleaned - unacceptable! We went to the front desk to complain and were offered free drinks at Monkey Board and reassured would be completed soon as well as told that hotel was full - that was why cleaning being done so late - not the customer's issue at all and should not be used as an excuse. Major inconvenience as we had been at French Quarter Fest all day and were planning to rest a little before getting ready for dinner. Also, elevator setup is less than optimal. Big line in lobby to get up to bar interfering with guests trying to get to rooms. Also, didn't seem to be separate service elevator from guest elevator - another dissatisfier. Nice looking hotel - rooms were actually very nice looking/well designed and decent location but really need to get the service kinks out before I would recommend to others and/or return. Lots of other great choices in NOLA....Thank you for your comments Josh, I'm very disappointed to read we didn't exceed your expectations. Your concerns have been shared with my Front Office Manager and Director of Housekeeping so that we can improve. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience and know that we can do much better. We definitely want to earn back your trust and certainly your recommendation. I'll be reaching out to you directly to see how we can do that.Thank youWayneGeneral Manager	3.0

I loved this hotel. It captures a distinctive golden age vibe in a very special way. On check-in, there was a small disturbance in the lobby due to the behaviour of another guest who was unhappy with her allocated room. The only blip during our stay was that the room we were allocated with an external view was clearly given to this complaining guest. The manager literally took the key from the hands of the lady checking us in as she was giving them to me (and after we had been told what a lovely room we had been allocated)... But the hotel was professional enough to deal with our concern immediately, and we were given a gorgeous external view room facing onto Fifth Avenue and complimentary breakfast and drinks. This rapid commitment to service was indicative of the rest of our stay. Otherwise, the whole stay was perfect. The room was elegant. It felt very classic and luxurious, but also had any modern convenience. The King Cole bar was the perfect place to meet friends. The complimentary Bentley was a special touch to drop us to dinner at a perfect concierge recommendation. We loved the atmosphere in the hotel restaurant the next morning for breakfast. I would stay here again without hesitation. We felt valued and special.Dear johntillett, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

We chose this accommodation due to its proximity to several sites. Museum of modern art is 1 minute walk, Space needle 1 minute walk and the monorail is a 1 minute walk.There is also a collection of restaurants and shops an easy 2 minute walk from the HotelWe checked in late, about midnight with friendly and efficient staff.The room has a queen bed with separate kitchen, bathroom and lounge room and is very comfortable.The Hotel has free tea and coffee in the foyer and a happy hour between 4.00pm and 7.00pm every night with US3.00 pints.Breakfast is sufficient with both hot and cold selections buffet style.The free shuttle to a radius of a kilometre was enough to get to Pikes market which was good.

Not much to complain about here. The resort is beautiful, the grounds are impeccable. The view from the lobby walking in is amazingly. Service at Dukes is great, food is good.

We had a wonderful stay in Seattle. Our hotel was steps away from many city attractions and restaurants. Hotel was clean, staff friendly, and room had a view. They served omelets at breakfast and the burgers in the bar/lounge were better than any on the street and available late at night!	5.0
This was a return trip back here and we were still very pleased with our stay. Check in was quick and easy. Our room was well appointed and immaculate.

Recently spent 2 months at MyPlace in Pasco WA. Newly built hotel it looked like, so everything in the room was new and clean. The room was serviced every 4 days as advertised and the maids always did a good job. The receptionists up front were all nice young girls.	5.0
This hotel is in a great location. It is close to many restaurants, and a short walk to the beach. I enjoyed my stay here very much and would stay here again. The only drawback is parking. There is certainly not enough!	4.0
I will never stay here again and its a shame because the facility and location were very nice. I booked and paid in full via Hotels.com. When I arrived and checked in their system messed something up and had a missing day in the middle of our 4 night stay. After waiting at the counter for over 20 minutes while the attendant the manager finally came over and gave us keys and assured it is fine the rate is the same and enjoy the stay. On the way to the room we were greeted by a lady attempting to sell the time shares. The lady was EXTREMELY rude, when we declined the information she made snippy comments like well don't you want to finish checking in. That was her sales tactic but standing there with room keys in my hand and not being born yesterday it was apparent she had nothing to do with us checking in. She also tried to bribe us with chocolate which was very juvenile. During check out and they told me I had a balance. I had to show them the paid in full email and remind them of what I was told when checking in. After going back and forth with the manager she is now going to call Hotels.com to resolve which she should have done in the beginning. The rooms were nice and location was fantastic but its a shame the desk staff doesn't have a clue, I will not be returning to this chain and also will push my friends and family to avoid it as well.	2.0
The 1st night we checked in was the night the crazy storm hit DC. We ended up losing power that night (Fri) and it still hadn't returned as of Mon. While this was by not their fault, it made the stay quite dreadful. We had a busy day on Sat, as we were looking for houses (we're moving to DC) and didn't get back to the hotel until late the hotels with power were sold out. The room was disgusting, so we slept in the car and checked out on Sunday. Apparently, that was a mistake. The girl at the front desk said it shouldn't be a problem to get reimbursed for that night and the pre-paid nights we didn't stay. However, we were told to call the manager, who said that it is not customary for them to refund us for a night in which our things were in the hotel, even though it was miserable and we couldn't sleep there (I should mention that there was record-breaking heat). Ultimately, she refunded us for this night and we were satisfied. Had the power not been an issue, the hotel was pretty nice. The rooms seemed clean and were recently renovated. The staff was really nice too (even though they were hot tired). The location is pretty decent. They are currently working on the orange line though, so it's closed on the weekends at New Carrollton. Fortunately, the Greenbelt stop is about a 10 min drive away and there's free parking on the weekends. Ultimately, I think we just had bad luck and our stay would have been perfectly fine if the power hadn't gone out on day one.	3.0
Good, quiet location. Away from the shops but still in the heart of it all. Within walking distance of everything including Grand Canyon railway. The usual noise from neighbors -- running water, doors closing and mumbled voices through the walls. I'd stay here again.	4.0
This is a case of another Vegas hotel that thinks that just because this is Vegas it can treat its patrons like cattle. When you drive up to the hotel there is a sign to self parking.

The room itself was as expected. I had no disappointments with the accommodations. The bus service to the strip was an added bonus. Unfortunately, we had a room closest to the IH-15 and facing towards the Las Vegas Strip and Las Vegas Airport. I didn't sleep very well due to the departing airplanes and the shrieks from the patrons riding the roller coaster at the New York, New York hotel. I suggest asking for a room facing away from the strip.	4.0
Overall miserable experience. Front desk was very unresponsive from start to finish at this Hilton location.

Perfect for one night visit to tour SDSU. Room was clean, looked newly renovated and very comfortable. Not sure I'd hang out at the pool, though.

What a nice little hotel in a gorgeous rural area near Carmel, CA. Both office staff members were very helpful and the hotel grounds and pool area are nicely maintained. The town itself is cute as can be and has several small cafes with outside seating and a couple of nicer restaurants for more formal dining.	4.0
Es un buen hotel. Ubicado muy cerca del metro y con servicio de transporte a la estacion gratis cada 30 minutos. El personal muy amable, en especial DANNY Y SAN, quienes son la salvacion de los que solo hablamos espanol. Las habitaciones muy buenas, aunque no lujosas, pero si por encima de las basicas de otros hoteles. al centro son 10 estaciones, no hay pierde pues es la ultima parada de una linea corta. aprox. 40 minutos. el desayuno bueno. En general volveria sin pensarlo y lo recomiendo. No te hacen ningun cargo extra.Si llegas despues de las 10:30 puedes tomar taxi muy facilmente, siempre hay 10 o 20 afuera y te cobran aprox. 10 dolares. A diferencia de otros hoteles un poco mas lujosos se caracterizan por ser muy amables y comprensivos. al frente hay toda clase de restaurantes, supermercados y algunos comercios	4.0

This hotel on the outskirts of Napa Valley provided an excellent base to tour this area. The staff were excellent and provided us with a lot of local information and recommendations for our specific requests.

I go to Seattle very frequently for business, and this hotel was the 5th that I've stayed in this city. The room was good and clean. Wifi was stable. TV reception was not the best, but wasn't bad eiter.The hotel is right by the lake, so a nice pleasant walk outside. It's also close to a few restaurants and a corner store.Overall, I think it was a good hotel.	4.0
Beautiful property and every staff member I encountered (front desk, housekeeping, breakfast hosts and GM) provided beyond excellent customer service! It's also conveniently located near restaurants, grocery stores starbucks and is a short drive to the freeways. I will definitely be back!	5.0
Bad: The entire place smells like an ashtray. The rooms were small and the place is noisy. It's a complete freak show under the canopy---ugly people who are 90 nude with no talent. Wall to wall beggars and hawkers. The entire Las Vegas is full of annoying street hustlers and creeps. What a waste of our First Amendment Rights! Next time I go to LV, I will stay in a South Vegas Hotel, go to a show and leave the next day. Too bad Vegas is stuck with such a beggar and homeless problem. Good: It was on my bucket list and I wanted to experience the canopy light show---ok, check it off. Good deals on food: Tony Roma's is located within the Fremont Hotel and steak and lobster for 11.99 is a DEAL! The Valet Parking was free and excellent. The entire Staff was excellent but seemed embarrassed to be in such a dump. It was cheap but you pay for it if your not a smoker.	3.0

Stayed here for 4 nights. Price was on the lower end of choices on Key West so we were prepared for some short comings. We were very surprised at the cleanliness of the grounds and size if the room given the price bracket. We had room 146, which put us on the inside, bottom floor. Very comfy king size bed, small fridge, dresser, and desk didn't come close to filling up the room. I paced it off to about 20x16! The bathroom was also spacious. No tub but a glass enclosed shower the size of a tub with plenty of pressure and hot water. The included breakfast was what I'd call a Continental Plus, as it also had scrambled eggs, sausages, and DIY fresh made waffles. Heated pool and pool bar too! Would definitely stay here again and highly recommended! Thank you for your comments. So glad you enjoyed our spacious clean rooms.

Hotel was beautiful. Parking is weird. Paid 20 a night or you have to figure out how to park outback for free. No microwave or fridge in room only avaliable in suites.

firstly try to park at the front (not the side) of the hotel if you can or in the garage which has direct access to the casinothe smoke from the casino floor doesn't tend to filter into the lifts and upper floors unlike in some of the downtown casinosthe rooms are very large and well appointed. those facing west have a great view of the las vegas stripwe got an early check in at noon which was good and the process was handled in a friendly but efficient way. ac in room was very efficient and the rooms were quiet when we were therelots of eating choices in the casino and surrounding area but you do need a car in order to take advantage of this as the distances and temperatures make walking a difficult optionhowever the local bus does appear to go to the airport on a regular basis and the casino also offered a shuttle there as wellrecommended	4.0

The day club is tantalising (I'm too old) but not so noisy that it spoils the pool vibe for non-clubbers. It can be a bit tricky to get sunbeams though - and too many are reserved for VIPs and...

Bad: Not much. Good: For several years, a group of us has met for the SEMA SHOW. We have always come over a day early, and met for fun and dinner at your 777 Microbrewery. This time we were booked at MAIN STREET STATION as well.We'll be back, particularly since you didn't charge resort fees.	5.0

We recently spent three nights at The NOPSI in New Orleans. Nothing but good things to say. Beautiful first impression - absolutely gorgeous lobby! Extremely friendly and helpful staff - from the doormen, the front desk folks, the concierge - everyone! The location was an easy walk to the French Quarter but far enough away from the not so nice part. And the rooms were great - spotless, comfortable and large. Nice bars in the lobby and on the roof and also in the adjacent restaurant (which had a very good breakfast). All in all, A+!Frank, Thank you for visiting NOPSI Hotel. Our service professionals strive to make our guests feel at home from the moment they walk through the doors. We are honored that our service has earned your recommendation and look forward to welcoming you back in the near future. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager	5.0
My review of this hotel is very bitter sweet... First of all beautiful place for a beach wedding! Private beach access and hotel has beautiful ocean views.

Ok, their computers were down when I checked in. The wait to check in was too long AND the person behind the desk allowed another guest to deliberately cut in front of me and when questioned I was given an explanation of 'I don't know'. Then when I checked in, I was given the wrong room because someone was already in it. When I went back to lobby, there was another long wait because apparently other guests were given the wrong room also. Also, the card I checked in with for incidentals was charged for the stay, even though, I've already paid through hotels.com. I am aware that circumstances arise that are sometimes out of their control and I believe the the situation was handled to the best of their ability. I was given free items from the lobby fridge for the rude guests that cut in front of me AND my room was upgraded for free because I was initially given the wrong room. Lastly, I was completely reimbursed for them charging twice on my card. The situations were handled efficiently and the staff was accommodating to my concerns, questions and needs.	4.0

Entire Staff were excellent, with special mention for Taunya and Kayla at the front desk. They were always cheerful,smiling, and very helpful. Great breakfast, only issue is that space is limited so you may have to wait to sit if you want to eat there. Our room was worn and dated....Hotel needs updating but from the looks of it they may be in the process of doing. Large outdoor pool was clean and well kept. Kids loved it :-) Many restaurants and a very nice shopping mall minutes away. Overall.... great value for the price.	4.0
We had 10 rooms asked the GM in advance to put the rooms close she said she would do her best. At check in, the front desk never received anything from their GM about our group. The hotel was dirty, online pics are deceiving. The rooms reeked of smoke some of us changed rooms. There was hair everywhere. I never saw a cleaning lady the entire time. There were only sheets on the beds, when I called the front for blankets they only had one to give to us so I gave it to my kids. The elevators were small filthy. Club guests were loud yelling in the halls from 9pm-3am. I had to ask the people next door to quiet down so my kids could sleep. Guests were smoking cigarettes weed in their rooms which overflowed into the halls. We had rooms on the 5th 6th floors it was like this for everyone. The pool was gross. The breakfast was decent, but they ran out of some food early. The staff was always nice besides the lady in the breakfast room who reminded me of a grumpy cafeteria lady. I had to wash everything that I took into that hotel when I got home, even if it was clean. My car stunk of stale cigarettes from our stuff being in it I had to get it detailed to get the smell out. This is not a family friendly hotel in any way, shape or form, DO NOT bring your kids here. If you want a cheap party hotel with a club where you can pass out drunk not care, this is right up your alley. Do yourself a favor spend the extra money.	1.0
I called to cancel my reservation because I booked in the wrong place. The guy did not understand what I was saying then responded with we charge already before he rudely hung up on me.

The hotel is located on an excellent and very convenient block. Very close to the action, but about a block away from the action at the same time.

I arrived this week for the whole week and I must say this place was a lot better that the Hilton garden inn down the street.

We stayed in a Signature Plus room at Best Western for 379 or something ridiculous like that. I wanted an unobstructed view of the red rocks when waking up and falling asleep.

This is by far the best Hampton Inn my wife and I have ever stayed in, and we've been in quite a few. For that matter, it's one of the best of its class among all of the hotels we've known. We had a nice, clean suite, quiet, well lit, neatly arranged with a desk/divider between the very comfortable bed and the sitting area. Staff were friendly and polite, the breakfast good, prices reasonable. Little notes left by the cleaners were a nice touch. Our only complaint was that the wireless Internet kept dropping out on checkout the desk clerk apologized and said that the hotel has been trying to solve this problem (our room also had an ethernet cable, unusual these days, but I hadn't brought an adapter for my laptop). In spite of this - not enough to affect the rating - highly recommended!	5.0
Not in the greatest area, but cant complain about the price per night. Hotel has been renovated, but has thin walls and has shaired doors with the rooms next door causing lots of the sounds to come from underneath. The doors are sturdy and solid, but makes a lot of noise when they close. Hotel is very close to the Amtrak and metro station, shuttles arived 10 min late but is available	3.0
This was third stay at Marriott and we have been pleased with all phases of service and comfort that Marriott offers to their visitors. They offers a great breakfast and the employees go out of their way to take care of us. If the visitor has their own rental car, they can visit the complete Vegas area as they wish. We came down for the Nascar races and we were happy with each visit. My boys and I recommend Marriott for a great place to stay in Vegas	5.0

Hotel was probably built in the 50's. Needs serious update. Not really clean but not too terribly filthy. Landscaping was nice in the garden area and the pool was fairly nice but showed its age.

Met a group of guys down in Portsmouth for a weekend of NSW training. Didn't spend a ton of time at the hotel but I was pleased with my stay. The room was very clean. Had a nice comfortable king bed. Plenty of room. Had a couch as well. Breakfast wasn't all that. Had a waffle maker, eggs, sausage, sausage sandwiches, cereal, bagels, toast etc.. the sausage was that microwave junk. ate it the first morning but that was it. I didn't check anything else in the hotel out or have a need to seek service. I would stay there again.	4.0

I 'crashed' here after an event, so I had done no research like I would have for a getaway. The location was perfect, the room small but stylish, the bathroom classic and efficient. Our bed wasn't as soft as I needed, but I got a decent night's sleep. After a very late night, we woke to a view of the Lincoln Park Zoo and Lake Michigan. We walked the neighborhood, enjoying the people, sights, scents, and vibe of Lincoln Park. I had zero expectations when I checked in, and definitely found myself wishing we were staying a few more days. The decor was classic and a bit whimsical. I loved it!	4.0
This hotel was absolutely wonderful. I was a little leary at first but I was happily surprised when I walked into the lobby. Everyone was very pleasant and helpful....except for the concierge the evening we arrived. He was super annoying and kept bugging us to talk to him for ideas of things to do. Our room was spacious and clean. Our room was broken into two areas...a bedroom and a living room, both of which had tvs. We were extremely pleased with our stay and would highly recommend this hotel.	5.0

Perfect hotel for a single female traveller. The hotel was clean, convenient, and steps away from major attractions. Easy to access by public transportation. The room is smaller than average, but not too small, and the perfect size for a traveller who is not planning on spending much time in the hotel room anyway. Computers with internet access a plus. Friendly staff. The only gripe I had was the elevators...there are only two of them, so visitors can wait a while for them to arrive.	5.0
I was here with my teenaged son. We enjoyed our stay at this quiet, well-maintained hotel in a residential part of Santa Barbara just a short walk from the mission, and a short walk from downtown.

Bad: The room I booked was a non-smoking but when we got to the hotel, the gentleman at the counter said they didn't have any and have not had any available for several days. The guy then said that in order for me to get my money back, I'd have to go through the third party that I booked the room through. Good: Nothing	2.0
The hotel is a bit dated and worn, but not terribly so. It is, however, located on the beach with Miami Beach's boardwalk directly behind the hotel. In the center of Miami Beach.

I stayed in two seperate rooms at this hotel. The first was 209 upstairs over looking the shared balcony. It was small but clean and gorgeous, perfect for one person. My only complaint is the Windows don't open, as they've been painted over. Would be nice to get some fresh air, although this room has its own thermostat with air. The staff was amazing and watched my bags for me the entire next afternoon after check out, as I wasn't sure if I was gonna stay again or not. I decided to stay, and they offered me a similar rate to the first night even though prices went WAY up. The girls at the front desk are super awesome. The next room I stayed in was downstairs, definitely larger than the first, just as beautiful but different. The energy was different, it was dark, and I had a few issues with cell phone reception, not picking up the guest wifi and a broken TV that they couldn't do anything about. Overall I loved staying at this hotel. It felt special. It is special. Its a fantastic hotel to stay at if you want the NOLA French Quarter experience. On a personal note: this hotel is definitely haunted. I not only had the same dream both nights that were pretty spooky and gruesome, but I awoke the second morning to someone humming softly into my ear and a grab/scratch at the back of my neck. Let's just say my heart was POUNDING!	4.0

Hotel was in decent shape and clean.  Bathrooms were very nice and redone but rest of room looked fine.

A beautiful, historic hotel in a perfect location with a fantastic staff (and great bar).

No complaints about quality of room. Breakfast was above average. Wifi was somewhat erratic, but that is so common these days it is almost not worth mentioning.

This hotel recently went through an update in regards to the furniture and televisions. I have to say that they did a great job. They didn't. however, replace the tile in the bathrooms to match the rest of the updates, which is a shame. The tub and pedestal sink looked new, but the toilet did not. But I have to say, that the bathroom was the cleanest I have ever seen. Not even one stray hair on the floor! The kitchen also skipped the update, but it was still nice to have a fridge, microwave and stove. All the essential items like utensils, dinnerware and cookware were stocked in the cabinets. Also, there is no wi-fi in the rooms, you have to go to the lobby. There is only a plug for high speed internet located in the room. The hotel is a great bargain for staying near D.C. and I would stay there in a heartbeat.	4.0

The Fairfield Inn Tracy is located close to the highway. Therefore road noise can be heard. However, the hotel is clean and the staff is excellent.

We requested 4 non smoking rooms. When we checked in we only had 2 non smoking and the hotel was sold out. My of thr rooms we had to kill a roach. Another room I was personally bite up from some type of black bug. They treated my room and offered to move me to there other location which was an inconvenience. The carpet in all of our rooms was dirty and mine was dirty and torn. One of the rooms had a 90 dollar charge under Other which the hotel could not explain so they removed it. And when they were checking my bed to see what was biting me, it was particulars on the box spring that did not belong to me. So how was that possible if they had put on new linen prior to me coming. I would not recommend this hotel nor would I return. They did give me two night comp stay for another location for my troubles but I dont beleive it was enough.	1.0

Bad: Our room view was pretty poor as it was looking out and into adjacent old building and seeing right into others apartments. Had to totally close blinds for any privacy. That blocked all of the natural lighting. A suggestion or 2: !. Letting people know where their room is located within the facility so they could ask for a different view if it was available. 2. Having blinds that pull up from the bottom (instead of down from the top) would allow some privacy from close buildings and still allow some natural light into the rooms that have this issue). Additionally some kind of break on parking would be a great addition. Our parking costs almost as much as one nights stay!. Good: Social Hour was unexpected and fun. Made some new friends!	5.0
I hadn't planned on staying at a hotel, I had planned to camp. It was a spur of the moment trip for me by myself and hadn't budgeted for the expense of a hotel.

Bad: Our room wasn't ready when we arrived at 4.30 (advised it would be ready from 4). They didn't have a two queen bed room as booked so we had to take a king and a roll in bed as there were 4 of us. Good: Good location and a good price	4.0

I was not expecting Scotty's Motel to be fancy considering the price but I was expecting clean. This was the second dirtiest hotel I have stayed in.

Beautiful hotel. For 109 you expect an average hotel but this is awesome. Automatic blinds, lights, huge bathroom. Nice standing shower with jacuzzi. Great cleaning staff, front desk, room service.

Confusing and less than desirable internet, front desk was no help. Room was so so. my particular room had an a/c that smelled like a dirty foot but perhaps it's just that room. Granite by rest room was weirdly stained, I'm not sure how that happens	2.0
In town for a sizeable training conference and was able to compare my hotel with the four other approved locations. This one was tops in upkeep, housekeeping, staff and price.

I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Holiday Inn Express Suites in the quaint and charming German-American town of Frankenmuth, Michigan.

We had a wonderful time on our 25th anniversary. We highly recommend this hotel and their staff including the Front desk, Consear, bellhops, valet and all the people working the restaurants(5) etc. We especially enjoyed the saltwater pools.. this is definitely a five star atmosphere - very Ohana! Thanks to Expedia for allowing us to book this trip on line from the comfort of her own home. Mahalo	5.0

If you're in Edison for whatever reason, this is the first, last and only hotel to consider staying at. Free parking, free wifi, free shuttle, free treats in the lobby, and friendly staff, I have NO negative complaints about this hotel. I loved my stay here!	5.0
Absolutely no negatives. Large room, comfortable bed. Quiet. Great wifi. Quiet A/C. The breakfast was much better than the typical free breakfast. Within walking distance to two good restaurants. The rail road museum in Altoona is close and interesting.	5.0
This resort is worth every one of its five diamonds! Stunning service with kindness, support and upgrades when any question came up. Ex.

My daughter and I checked in late after driving all day. The room we were originally set to be in was marked as not ready in the system, so we were assigned to a larger room. When we got into the room, overall, everything appeared to be clean. However, when we went to the bathroom to turn on the shower, we noticed that the shower/tub had not been cleaned (or if it had, it was not done well). There were several dark hairs still in the bathtub, as well as small stumbles from a man. This was quite disgusting and not what we wanted to deal with at the late hour. I did my best to wash out and wipe down the tub, but we quickly showered with our flip flops on and went to bed. In the morning, we woke up and checked out quickly because it just felt dirty in the room. I did let the clerk know about our room upon checkout, and she stated that she would let the head of cleaning know.	2.0

The room was smaller than expected for the price paid per night. We have stayed at Indy for the motorcycle races and paid less for a much bigger room. It was also further from the Indy Race track then expected. Room was clean, comfortable, breakfast good.	4.0

We had an amazing time and love it there. Quaint cottages, beautiful pool and a fun game room. The family who owns it is incredibly sweet. Overall I'd rate it a 10 if I could. The beds were comfy, everything was clean, the tables and outside chairs make it a great place to relax and enjoy the fresh air.	5.0
La nostra camera era pulita, spaziosa e il letto molto comodo.La colazione e la solita che si trova in questi posti,era ok.Abbiamo scelto questa struttura per un pernottamento, in viaggio. Rimane un po' fuori a Norfolk, ma e anche vicina da Virgina Beach e per cui era una ottima scelta, visto i prezzi che ci sono al mare. Consiglio questa struttura a viaggiatori o anche per lavoro senza problemi.La qualita ricevuta per il prezzo e buono.	4.0
The property is very attractive inside and out.

The hotel is clean, size of the room was good and the pool area is nice, but the overall look of the place is cheesy, the AC in the room was noisy and hard to control, and there's no free internet! Worse than that, they have a tiered internet pricing scheme that went up to 40 for 2 days!	3.0
Stayed here with a friend while in town for a football game. The staff was so nice, funny and accommodating.

I wish I could separate the room experience from the breakfast experience but I can't because having breakfast included was a huge part of why we chose this hotel. Not enough seating, not enough staff, and most importantly not enough food. Today is our third breakfast here and they have run out of food each day. Today they are out of milk and waiting for a delivery. We bought milk from the hotel store to put on cereal and then realized it was expired. Guests are lined up six or 7 deep waiting for the breakfast sandwiches to be replenished. As we sit here now, it has been 30 minutes and there is still no milk. That said, the room itself has been very pleasant. Just don't plan on eating breakfast here.	3.0
My stay here was what I expected. The staff is friendly enough, and the hotel is pretty clean. The parking can be tricky because when I arrived after 6p, it seemed to be pretty full.

One of our rooms was above a restaurant/bar/lounge which was playing very loud music for several hours after midnight. The noise from the bar kept me awake for hours. As you can imagine, this made for a most undesirable stay. In addition, the temperature in the rooms was very cold and the beds had only a thin blanket on them. There were no extra blankets in the rooms and there was not a thermostat in the rooms that would have allowed us to control the temperature.	3.0
The hotel was convenient to the interstate, the mall and Baltimore. Breakfast was good. The room was comfortable and the staff was pleasant.	4.0

This hotel is an easy on / off from the freeway. The hotel staff were polite and courteous. The rooms were quiet and comfortable. During both of our stays, we were the only ones using the pool and that was a bonus. The breakfast bar impressed us with the variety of options available. Definitely recommend this hotel!	5.0
Bad: Best days of this hotel are far behind and the interior would need a major upgrade. When you enter the Room you first notice a bad smell due to combination of moisture and lack of proper ventilation. The air condition was extreamely noisy. You can also hear all voices from the corridor and other rooms. Good: Good location. There was a comlimentary coffee machine available at the lobby. Good bed.	3.0

Our stay was nice. The hotel is located not too far away from Mayland live and the Mills mall. If you don't have transportation of your own (as we did not since we were visiting from out of state)the hotel does offer transportation within a 5 mile radius which includes the casino and the airport. The airport is priority for the hotel so if there is an airport trip or pick up, the airport will take priority over the casino or the mall. The casino and airport are not walkable even though you can see the casino from the hotel window as there are no sidewalks all the way. The breakfast is complimentary and is better then we have seen in most hotels. We do advise you to go before 7:30 for the breakfast as it gets crowded down there. The walls are very thin and you can hear the people on the other side of the wall if they are loud. The people on the other side of us were loud until close to 6AM when they finally went to sleep. Since I keep the same hours when I travel as to when I don't, this part was disturbing to me.	5.0

Im not sure if Ill be other reviewers are used to sleeping in tents, because I dont understand why it would be so great about this place. It has a feeling of age about it, like it was built 30 years ago and trying to look modern but failing.While Ive stayed in the worse hotel rooms, theres certainly nothing distinctive for attractive about this place. Frankly, my wife and I were thinking that we wouldve been better off just trying to sleep at the airport terminal then spend the night here.Thank you for taking the time to provide us feedback about your stay! I am sorry that you were not impressed with our facilities. We just had our exterior renovated in April 2018 and we look forward to getting an interior refresh soon. We like to think that so many of our guests give us great reviews because of our exemplary service. If your travels ever bring you to Atlanta again, we would love to have you back as our guest.Warm Regards,Justina H.General Manager	3.0

Building is 4 story, approximately 4 years old. The staff is very efficient and quite friendly (Just what you expect when in Mississippi). Good breakfast.

What a wonderful stay. It was our parent's 50 Year Anniversary and the hotel was amazing. The staff (especially Chris at the front desk) with restaurant recommendations and a local florist that delivered flowers that the hotel made sure where in the room when we arrived.

This place is old and dated. The bed was really uncomfortable. They put a thick pad on top of the mattress I guess to make it better. Instead it just gets wadded up when you sleep.

I stay in a lot of Motel 6s and have been satisfied with just about all of them I've tried. This one is a notch above the typical Motel 6. The location is great -- I walked to World of Coca-Cola and some good restaurants -- and the free parking helps make it a real bargain. The place is clean and well maintained and t staff was pleasant and helpful. I walked both day and night and never felt in danger though I did have to deal with a couple of panhandlers. No surprise there.	4.0
Very comfortable and relaxing.... But, most of all the quietness and friendliness of the employees.	5.0
Bad: Nothing to dislike at all!. Good: As a first time visitor to Chicago, the hotel was an excellent central location from which to explore. Firstly, the property, services, cleanliness, wifi and staff were very good. As mentioned by other users, there is a continental buffet served on a credenza on each floor outside the elevators from around 6.30 am. Some may want a more sumptuous offering, but this is a very generous continental breakfast and would be more than sufficient for most. Travelling to the hotel from O'Hare was simple. If you can read and follow English signs, it's an easy and cheap transition on the Blue Line public train into town. The hotel website gives precise information on which stop to disembark and the 5-10 minute walk to the property. Probably a better option to use taxis, Uber etc if you are travelling with lots of luggage or you have mobility issues. As for food and entertainment, the hotel is surrounded by excellent options. Restaurants and bars of all types abound. The House of Blues is right across the road for example. River Walk is also a highlight and is only a 3 minute walk away. The hotel area is well serviced by public transport and taxis, plus the first stop of Hop On/Hop Off Bus tour company is 5 minutes away in front of the Trump Building. As in other cities and countries that offer this service, it's an excellent way to get a quick feel for a new place, and Chicago is a stunning place to visit. By the way, Buddy Guy's Legends Bar is well worth a visit. People will always have various expectations, but I found the staff, service, amenities, and most of all the music on the night, to be fabulous as a musician and huge blues fan, this was a big tick on my personal bucket list. The H.O.B was also great, but didn't have time to get down to Rosa's Bar or Kingston Mines. I'll leave that for the next time............................but will be staying at the Kinzie.	5.0
The website looked great, the pictures and description and the cert. of exc. from TripAdvisor and, at the time 4.5 stars led me to choose this. But when we got here the place was so very different from what we expected. We paid 357 per night, and felt it was really more of a 150 - 200 per night place.... More	3.0

We stayed here and really enjoyed our stay. Nice rooms, clean although the carpet in the room we stayed in needs to be replaced. This hotel did pay attention to our special requests, which rarely happens and sometimes those little things make a BIG difference. We didn't try the breakfast but we will next time we stay here.	4.0
My husband and I just stayed here at Econo Lodge Inn Suites for President's Day Weekend and had a very nice stay. The lady at the front desk was very kind and courteous.

My wife and I were spoilt silly by sheer hospitality. We had a wonderful stay, my only issue was that we could not be given a hard bed (mattress) so I experienced back pain throughout our stay.	5.0
The staff was nice, room didn't smell funny like many do. Small repairs were needed. But there is a lot of noise. Could hear everything from above, including walking, and dogs barking....yes..they allow animals. And when people let their door slam it shook the whole room. It happened often. The bed was very hard, and when I turned the fan/heat on it blew the curtain out and away from the window limiting privacy.	3.0
Hotel was in reasonable conditio. We were upgraded to a junior suite. The room was nice, reasonable clean and confortable and located near a Metro Station. The neighborhood was questionable, though we had no problems, I wouldn't recommend going out at night. Breakfast was limited, but plenty of food.	4.0
Fantastic buy for the money. My wife and I were very pleasantly surprised. Breakfast was OK with waffles, sausage, scrambled eggs, etc. The place has been remodeled and updated, but we found the imperfections to be few and small. The travel service to the Metro station was quick, which was very important since we stayed there for 4 days.	5.0

Welcome to one of the most iconic and beautiful hotels of Manhattan! Marble, crystals, golden leaf paintings, elegantly decorated rooms combining newest technology and extreme comfort in a charming style that one may find somehow a little bit Marie Antoinette. Kind staff, great Doorman from Bretagne, Champagne sabotage at the Bar. Maybe some room for improvement on the side of the kitchen to refine the bar menu and breakfast. A wonderful home feel. Congrats and Thank you! Dear jfcollobert,On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we would like to thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at our hotel. We are pleased to hear how much you enjoyed your stay and that our team provided you with excellent service.

We stayed here for 5 nights after a luxurious 10 night cruise around the Hawaian islands. The hotel is a basic tourist hotel clean and comfortable and the staff helpful.

We decided to stay a few extra days in Vegas and found a good offer at the Suncoast, plus we wanted to spend our mornings hiking in Red Rock. The positives: economical, close to Red Rock, large pool, lots of parking, large rooms, nice staff. Negatives: old, the carpets are shaggy like the atmosfere in general. In the end we wound up just sleeping and spending the afternoons on the Strip, which takes 30 minutes by car.Thank you for your review. Sounds like you enjoyed most of your stay, and you will be pleased we are going through a full scale remodel of our hotel rooms. I think you will be pleased with our new rooms, and we look forward to your future stay. Have a nice day.	2.0
We always use Hyatt for all inclusive vacations but this time traveling through the US we decided to try Hyatt House. We were traveling with our 2 dogs - we were a little taken back by the non-refundable pet fee of 75 for nights 1-7, we were only staying one night and thought this was a little steep. However, after checking in and seeing the cleanliness of our room, being a pet friendly room you expect to find at least one sign another dog had been there - Nope! Immaculate! Great cleaning staff! This location is very convenient and we will stay here again. The hot breakfast was delicious. The staff very accommodating. Nice place all the way around. 5 stars!	5.0
This hotel is very nice. Comfortable bed, lots of room, great Breakfast. The only cheesy thing was their evening snack at happy hour. It was potato chips and cheese with a variety of dry snacks. They may as well have put out pretzels and nuts and called it a day. I expected more.	5.0

We stayed in Nobu which is a great location in Caesars Palace. Rooms are a bit smaller than the Augustus Tower where we usually stay. The room is well appointed and the bed is soooo comfortable. The free coffee and water is a nice touch.	5.0
After paying $150-160 dollars for one night I was totally disappointed that there was no free breakfast or free WiFi and on top of that you had to pay $16 a night to park, totally outrageous!  I have had all of the above plus free parking at cheaper but nice hotels.	3.0
The Found:Re is a unique hotel is special city: part hotel, part Art gallery, this is one fun place to stay. My wife and I love it for it's ever changing, with new works of Art installed regularly. The property is centrally located, features a nice restaurant, Match, and is just across the street from FEZ, one of favorite eateries outside the hotel proper. The Found:Re is also a short walk from the Phoenix Art Museum, which is on par with some of the best in San Francisco, Denver, Chicago, and New York.We appreciate the kind words! We look forward to seeing you again!	5.0

Every Year myself and some friends go to the dells to hit up the bars. This hotel is right downtown, so you are walking distance to all the bars. The owners were very nice.

It's pretty obvious the owner is letting this place run down while he collects exorbitant rates (weekends) for a room. My room was clean and very spacious. It also showed signs of lone term neglect.

We were using this hotel for a family of 5 in conjunction with Sesame Place.

We stayed in a Queen with a private bath. Even this room was way too small. When I opened the door, I could barely get my luggage in without hitting the bed. We picked the romance package which came with a bottle of Edgefield sparkling wine, handmade local chocolates and massage oil. Very nice! We didn't eat here because we both feel McMens has grown tired - and there are so many great new restaurants in McMinn. If you like a tiny room with a creepy atmosphere, this place is for you!	2.0
We would have left this hotel immediately, except that it was very late at night, and we just wanted to get a few hours of sleep. We were in room 219.

We chose Aloft because we were able to use our credit card points towards our stay and it was the closest and cheapest we could find the French Quarter. With that being said we are happy with our choice. When we first arrived we were greeted warmly by the front desk staff Jermal was great. We got to our room on the 12th floor and were happy with the amenities. The room was not as large as I would have thought, but it was comfortable and a non issue since we spent minimal time in the room. There was a coffee pot, a mini fridge, and lots of mirror space. Our view overlooked the Ritz Carlton and we were able to see their pool and patio area- pretty cool. The beds are comfortable and the towels didn't feel like sandpaper. They provide Bliss toiletries which was fine, however, I did not pack shampoo or conditioner and they offered a shampoo conditioner all-in-one which I did not care for (but my husband loved...). The vanity area has intense lighting good for makeup application!The lobby area is very nice and fun. They have a snack area for any cravings you have when you are there- premade salads sandwiches, candy, chips, fruit, yogurt, beer, juice, pop, etc. The lobby bar is very nice- good drinks and a fun environment. Lots of games and fun dcor. LaKisha (I hope I spelled that right!) was very friendly and did a great job. They do offer a pool table and computers/printer which came in handy to quickly print our boarding passes. The only issues we ran into was the room service for our room, they did the bare minimum in cleaning our room. The bed was always made, toiletries and towels were always replaced, however, that was about it. No trash was picked up and nothing was organized. When you go to a hotel, typically they neatly arrange your items so they can clean the room/bathroom/vanity completely, but this was not the case. Our toiletries were shoved to a corner or moved over so they could place new toiletries, I had a half eaten sandwich placed on a shelf instead of being thrown away, the coffee pot wasn't put back or the coffee replenished (but new coffee cups were given), whatever was left on the bed was thrown back on it, there was a bottle cap left on the floor... small things that added up. This wasn't huge issue, but enough of one to notice and let the front desk know as we checked out. Also, the elevator functioned oddly for my husband once. He was brought to the top floor and then back down to the lobby instead of being brought to our floor.. but that was not a huge deal.. just odd!Our friends who were staying on the 11th floor experienced some poor water pressure and cold water, however, we did not.The hotel is in a good location- two blocks from Canal and two blocks up from Bourbon- easy walking! The valet out from was super helpful when we were getting ready to leave by reserving us a taxi so we did not have to wait when we wanted one and put our items in the vehicle while we were checking out to make the process smooth and efficient. All in all, the hotel was a great choice and we'd recommend and stay there again. For being brand new, they did a great job!Fantastic! Thank you for your feedback, with us being a new property, reviewers like yourself help us get better! We are thrilled that you liked the property and all of the outlets like our WXYZ Bar and Re:fuel pantry. We cant wait to have you back here with us again soon.We truly appreciate your review and thank you again for staying with aloftnola.- Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager	4.0

The South Street Hotel costs about one-half of the rate at the Hanover Inn. True, you do not look out your window onto the Dartmouth Green, but you can walk to it in two blocks.

We visited Uno's this past winter. The atmosphere is great, the servers were cutious and very nice people, and the pizza was killer.

Front hallway light was out when we first walked into our room. Super tiny bathroom but that was expected for the price.

We picked this hotel for price and location - it's a quick drive to the MFAH and walking distance from the George Brown Convention Center.

We'd happily stay there again.	5.0

This was a horrible stay. The hotel was run down and dirty. We were not able to get to our reserved king room because supposedly the battery in the door was going bad and couldn't get in after going back to the office 3times. We were finally given a room with double bed. We would have gone elsewhere but ther were no vacanicies in the town. When arriving after driving for hours we were told there was no restroom to use and then trying to get into our room with no success, we ended up going to a restaurant next door. We will never go to the Super 8 in Crawfordsville again. When we told them we were unhappy with a room with a double bed, we were told you wont be able to do anything since you didn't go through them directly (since we booked through hotels.com)	1.0

Very nice staff. (They must have fired all the the rude people I read about in the reviews. LOL) Safe area (for New Orleans. For the people who said it was in a bad neighborhood, this is not Mayberry. ) The cost was a bit excessive in my opinion. Over 250 for one night ( although that did include parking. and it was an event weekend.) The facilities are nice. You can sit on the wrought iron balcony and watch the French Quarter wake up. The location is convenient and close to everything. The only reason this is not a 5 star review is that the shower was dirty. For that kind of money, I at least want to wash my old behind in a clean shower. The bed was VERY FIRM. It was too firm for my wife and me, but I hear some people like firm mattresses, so this would be right up your ally if you do. The second floor seems to be the best as far as views, I think. Third floor could be a beating on older folks because of the stairs. Also, there are two seperate hotels. I saw where a lady was complaining about having to walk from the office to another building. This is because she went to the wrong one, initially. There is French Quarter Suites, and New Orleans Courtyard Hotel. I think the NO Courtyard is a little higher end. Overall good experience. I will be back, but not on an event weekend.	4.0

I cannot recall the last time I had an issue at a Drury Inn. Well, we did not have one at this location. The room was comfortable, the staff was attentive and helpful, and it was nicely priced more importantly, we got the last available room for the evening. Next, their complimentary breakfast was good, as well as their late afternoon meal from 5 PM 7 PM. Also, you have to have a key card to access their customer parking area.

Bad: The hotel bathroom should be remodeled as the bathtub looks quite old. The drain gets clogged easily, and the basin tap handle looks like it is about to fall apart. No free WiFi. No fridge. And even no coffee-maker/kettle. Good: Good location with a few minutes walk to the Mob museum. The hotel is located in the heart of Fremont Experience. Both northbound and southbound bus stops are just beside the hotel building. Besides, the staffs are quite friendly. The buffet was satisfactory, and the price is cheap due to the 10 off for guests every meal.	4.0
I love the St Regis (generally speaking but especially the New York). I've stayed here 12 times over the last 4 years or so. It just seems to get better each time. Tire's a great new feature which is the Rooms control Manager (Molly) emailing me ahead of time to see when we would be arriving. My SPG upgrade available when we arrived at about 1015AM which is rare these days. Then there is the front desk staff - they are all wonderful but I want to call out Shelomie and Hugo who know Ryne and I by name and immediately make us feel at home. How about that concierge desk - again all are great but today I'll call out Krista and McKinley. I emailed while on the plane about getting in to the Salon for Mani and a shave. Our appointments were made and ready for when we arrived. Our Butler this trip was Marianna. She is awesome and gave us the utmost service during our stay. Finally Kevin and Juan our In Room dining attendants - just as perfect as can be. I named names because this is what this place is about.

This hotel more than met our expectations, very close to the metro station, 5-10 mins walk, but a free shuttle bus operates anyway so you don't have to walk. Very close to Washington and Arlington Cemetery. The neighbourhood felt safe and we had no fear of walking out even late at night, highly recommended.	5.0
This is a great deal. The amenities are awesome and include a cocktail hour with a hot bar. The location is ideal, and the staff is excellent. The building is well maintained and the rooms are spacious, comfortable, and attractive.	5.0
Great little getaway for our anniversary. Bed was comfortable, staff very nice and friendly, room very clean. Would stay again soon.	5.0
We stayed here on our way down to Florida. The hotel was nice and the staff was super helpful. The only problem we had was that the fridge in the room wasn't working in our room but the staff took care of it very quickly and provided us with a new fridge.

We spent 4 days in the hotel. Staff friendly and very helpful, they even got us beach chairs and umbrella so we can spend time at the beach. Staff knew where to direct you for food, beaches etc. and went out of their way to be of service. Room comfortable. Breakfast very good. The overall stay was very good. The... More	5.0
What's really unpleasing is that the hotel has no windows that can be opened and the air conditioning system has old filters, as much as I can say. There's a 'smell' of old air throughout the hotel and in the room (I was), which could only be explained with less than efficient functioning of the a/c system.	4.0
This establishment took over from the aging but historic Hotel Bellotti. They have remodeled and opened the place up so that you now can see main street and watch the sights and sounds while dining if you wish. They have a balcony as well that is sometime open for service. The wait staff was very attentive and the food was... More	4.0
Yes, it's still an EconoLodge but well kept up. Indoor Pool, sauna, pool table, laundry, fridge, microwave, etc. they even have a breakfast that's not too bad, waffles, cereal, juice, the usual. It's a little hidden away with a couple of other hotels maybe 5 minutes drive off the freeway. You probably see it fom the freeway but. . .... More	4.0
I was happy considering I used to live in Flint and I'm wary about the hotels there. Everything was clean and in good condition. Shower was hot and staff was nice. Area is very convenient.	5.0
Outstanding hotel, location not as convenient as I remembered with respect to fast food restaurants for that quick bite to eat. Very quiet area (well, it is dead of winter), but just the same we enjoyed the peace and quiet.	5.0
Clean, modern, friendly staff and great location to the airport. Food available nearby. It is a quiet and secure neighborhood that is especially good for business travelers. Lives up to the reputation of the brand.	4.0
We were tired from a very long drive from Boston and were very happy with everything that we saw. The staff were very professional and very nice. The bed was very comfortable. I would highly recommend this place. The Breakfast was very varied and great. Everything was fresh.	5.0
Arrived to discover an outrageous parking fee (also did not offer any disabled veteran discounts). Check in was ok until we discovered the entire college football team was arriving that night. The room was ok, the thermostat did not work so the room was very warm. It wasn't until later that night that the football enthusiastic kicked in and needless to say, we managed about two hours of sleep. You would figure the hotel would have informed us of this when we booked the room or at least would have had the decency to tell the rude guest to hold the noise down since it was after midnight. Needless to say I could not recommend this hotel to anyone else.	1.0
Overall room was nice, staff was nice and breakfast Buffett was typical. We had 3 days with luke warm water in the am, warmed up later in the day so we just switched out showers to the evening. No real restaurants in walking distance and the one that is located in the parking lot was probably one of the worst... More	3.0

6 friends on a very short break completely blown over by The Aria. Everything very efficient from start to finish during our stay.Location perfect.

The lobby areas very clean, casino not... More	5.0
Front desk attendant wasn't available on arrival. Had to call her to open the door to let me into the hotel itself- that was a first for me. Then she proceed to be rude through out the check in process. AC was loud as a lawn mover. Kept me up all night. Worst one night stay ever. Big nope.	1.0
I have to say I had a great stay,...The rooms were very nice and the staff was very helpful....What more can you askThe bar down stairs was nice to have so you did not need to go out if you really didn't want to. They are located within dozen of place for Uber Eats if your staying in. Awesome!

I didn't realize until after a Week later after my stay that I left over 100 worth of medical back therapy equipment. I didn't think to call but I have to admit I am disappointed that no one from the hotel bothered to contact me with these items that were accidentally left	3.0

Overall this is a very nice hotel with well appointed suites. We were in town for a couple of family functions so we didn't use most of what was available in either the room or the other facilities that were offered by the hotel. A couple of comments an not really complaints are that the fitted sheet on the bed was put on the bed inside out and was not fitted very well to the mattress (it just looked kind of sloppy) and there were spatter marks on the wall next to the bed that looked like they could have easily been wiped away. The rest of the room appeared to be very clean. They were even steam cleaning the carpets in the hallways while we were there. All of the staff was very friendly. Each of the housekeepers we met in the hall always gave us a friendly greeting. The breakfast offered a good variety and everything seemed fresh. A buffet meal is offered Monday through Thursday but we were not there on those days to be able to comment other than to say what was on the monthly menu posted in the room looked pretty good. The hotel is close to the airport , about 10 minutes to Virginia Beach Town Center, and only a 15 minute drive to Virginia Beach. It is located in an industrial park and is conveniently located near numerous dining and shopping facilities.	4.0
Very nicely decorated in retro fashion. Loved the steamer versus the traditional iron.Very friendly and accommodating staff.Although location is within walking distance to the French Quarter, would not recommend walking late at night. We found ourselves a bit turnaround when walking back from French Quarter. We stopped in at the Emergency Department of Tulane Hospital for directions who advised us that it was not safe to be walking in this area. They called us a cab despite the fare being very short (a few blocks). Thank you for taking a few minutes to share your experience. The comments of our guests are important for others to get a feel of our property and location. Sorry to hear you got turned around, be sure to let our concierge assist you with a map on your next visit.WayneGeneral Manager	4.0
This is a great little hotel tucked away on Wall's Main Street. Clean, comfortable, quiet and the softest towels I have ever experienced at any hotel !! The lady at the front desk was so helpful and pleasant. Would definitely stay there again!!!!	4.0
Bad: Only down side was the breakfast as hot choices were always overcooked splitting hairs as a coffee drinker would say coffee was awful. But you have perfectly good diner 2 block away so no big deal. Good: Location, rooms, front Terrace and great staff plus the hotel was super clean and well presented. Will definitely be back. Not forgetting beach towels provided and sun loungers on the beach.	5.0
If I wanted to be nitpicky, there might be some stuff to improve. But I am not and we were very pleased with our room, especially for the Priceline special price we paid.

Came up quickly upon the alternate entrance on the road from Pigeon Forge. It is an old but decent property. Enjoyed the stay and environs.

Bad: Used my debit card to pay for room.. Normally charges are taken out day you leave but they took them out day I arrived then charged 76 extra just incase I broke or damaged something-they said I would get it back but it was still pended out of my account. Good: Loved the free breakfast	4.0
Stayed here for a short stay in Chicago - easy for travel as it's no more than a five minute walk from Jackson Station on the blue line from the airport.The hotel is conveniently located for downtown locations - some such as Sears Tower are within easy walking distance while others are no more than a short cab ride or a hop on the blue or red line away.While not huge the room we had was clean, tidy and had everything we needed. The staff were friendly and helpful.My only minor moan would be that we made the booking well in advance and the room rate seemed to be a good bit higher than that quoted on-line by the hotel just before we left.	5.0
Meant to book Sky Suites due to great previous experience, mistakenly booked Tower Suites. Complementary pick-up drop-off at Airport makes a huge difference to the overall experience. Separate check-in and lounge does away with long wait at check-in, lounge also offers snacks light breakfast. So far, comparable to Sky Suites but not quite so up-scale. Suite itself was... More	4.0
When I checked in the clerk asked me what brought me to Pittsburgh, and I told her it was our anniversary.

This hotel was a great pic. The staff is very friendly, helpful, and seem to love their jobs. Even the maids had big smiles on their faces. The hotel itself is elegant and cozy, with a great bar and restaurant, nice outdoor courtyard, great pool and outdoor patio area, and small but nice rooms. Comfortable beds. The bathrooms could use more counter space and towel racks, but are clean and updated. Hotel location is great and is within walking distance to everything. The valet parking is expensive (~$29 a day) which is a pet peeve of mine - I think the parking should always be included. However the valet staff is also very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this hotel.	5.0
We stayed at the King Charles Inn for one night. The staff was very welcoming and accomidating. The manager greeted us and checked on our satisfaction. The location was excellent. We would definitely recommend this hotel!	5.0
I say that because I cancelled my second night stay from an awful hotel downtown and booked my second night at the Hotel Lincoln. Best decision I made the whole trip. The room was great (spacious, clean, well furnished and very modern) and the staff was even better. My wife had a bad stomach ache in the middle of the night and I called down to the front desk and asked if they had any Pepto-Bismol. They said no and started telling me where the nearest Walgreen's was and then stopped and offered to get some money from me and go get it for me since it was the middle of the night. I was super greatful and tried to give him a tip, he wouldn't take it. And that is just one example of how excellent the staff was. Next trip to Chicago I'm staying here again!	5.0

Bad: staff r not helpful at all, room was really soooooo tiny even I booked large room, but the staff gave me two options,, if I want the large room I booked,,,, I have to go up a stair with my luggages, then down a stair again with my luggage to the basement, then walk through a hall way to reach my large room,,, or get a tiny one so I can use the elevator and make it easier for me to reach a room with all my luggages. really Bad experience,, I paid 200 a day for this SH,, I would Pay only 160 at Bellagio LAS VEGAS and get the best service in stars hotel,,,better than this hotel charlesMark. dont book this hotel Pals in case u have other options.

We stayed here end of July 2015. We picked the room here because it was central to some places we were going on vacation. I don't know why this was rated at a 2!! If you want a 5 star hotel then book a five star hotel! Hotel was very clean and updated. Free breakfast was excellent. Pool was nice. Room was great. Only downside was beds weren't the greatest. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Can't beat the price and get all that anywhere else. Was a small hotel which was fine for us. Made it that much more homey. Would definatly recommend staying here.	5.0
The front desk had the most negative attitude I have ever seen in my entire life. He did not want to give us a room. He was not only rude to me but to other guest as well. Most of them were elderly which really bothered me. Because he was so rude we did not stay 6 days as planned,... More	3.0

I could not stay because the room that was given to my family and I was dirty and with a bad smell. The sheets had yellow dirty spots and to add to all this, the air conditioner did not work. The hotel did not want to give my money back, but when I called Hotel.com they took care of everything to me. I've got my refund.	1.0
Good: We liked everything about this hotel from the moment we arrived till we left. We were greeted by Mia a very friendly and helpful receptionist. We were given a lovely room overlooking the Boston marathon finishing line with views of the Trinity church and Boston public library. We found our room to be very clean with plenty of space and a very comfortable bed and a great sound system.On our first night we went to their wine and cheese tasting event which we found to be great fun and a great way to mingle with the locals. The staff play a great role in the success of this hotel under the brilliant management of the very hospitable Jefferson who by the way makes a great cocktail especially our favorite the Bloody Mary. We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel as it is right beside public transport (T) and the airport shuttle drops you across the street. We also found we could walk to most of the tourist sights. The complimentary continental breakfast was a bonus. Thanks Charlesmark for a great few days, hope to visit you again in the near future	5.0

This hotel is not on the beach ( 10 minute walk away ) but overlooks the canal which runs parallel to the beach, 2 blocks back.

The hotel itself is lovely and the staff were very kind and helpful. Just a couple of downsides the shower gel was low throughout our stay and you could get hardly any out i was a bit surprised this wasn't checked during housekeeping. The shower itself also wasn't very powerful. We had a clock in the room but it wasn't showing the right time and appeared to be out of battery didnt think this looled very good. The air conditioning was quite noisy but you could get a good temperature. We enjoyed our stay though as i said just a few minor things.	4.0

My family and I were surprised at just how good this place is. Given its location right in the heart of Seattle Center and its affordability, we thought for sure something was amiss. Parking in the area is expensive, here it is 25/day with full in/out privileges in a protected garage. The rooms are spacious, with a kitchen (microwave, stove, full fridge/freezer, sink, etc.) with an elevated dining table. Add the spacious bedroom, bathroom, and sitting area and you have a comfortable place for four to stay. The full breakfast is above average but the real hidden gem is the H Bar. We ate here a couple of times and the food is outstanding. The happy hour features a good selection of 3 local tap beers and the place is never really crowded. I'm not sure the tourists know they can come in otherwise I could imagine thirsty and hungry tourists at Seattle Center walking the minute or two to here, having a beer and a bite, and easily going right back to the Space Needle. I searched for the H Bar on Trip Advisor, but it's not there. NOTE TO HYATT HOUSE: You might consider getting the H Bar added as a restaurant if you want to increase your business.Thank you for completing a TripAdvisor regarding your recent stay at our hotel.

Traveling on business and stayed two nights. Staff were excellent. Hotel was very clean and quiet. The pool area looked like lots of fun if you have kids with you. Breakfast room was really nice and food was actually very good. I would stay again. Cheers	5.0
Bad: The fan in our room made a ticking sound throughout the night which was annoying. Also, there are not many choices for food. A couple of flat breads are offered for dinner. Breakfast is more reasonable with pastries, bagels, and fruit. Good: The bed was very comfortable. The space in the room was well used. Very clean.

Room was dirty, black hairs and grass on bathroom floor, tub liner was disgusting, old tube style TV and only had 1 washer and 1 dryer. I have a handicap and was put on the 2nd floor about 11-12 rooms away from the elevator. No luggage carts available which made it difficult for me to bring up my belongings. I would NOT recommend this Super 8 even though it was close to all we wanted to see in the Dayton area.	1.0
I was really pleased with the choice I made to stay at this Best Western. I needed a place close to the Pentagon and this hotel was not more than 10 minutes from the Springfield-Arcadia metro stop and right off of route 95 so it was the perfect location! There were plenty of restaurants nearby and the staff at the front desk were extremely nice. The only problem was that our room was right next to the elevator and we were awakened more than once during the nice by some loud guests. Other than that, I was satisfied with everything else including the price.	4.0

It's a standard Embassy Suites, just super overpriced. Staff is friendly. Saw a roach at breakfast. And overall, breakfast is pretty basic/tasteless. Good location - shuttles to reagan and pentagon city metro. No shuttles to IAD. Considering there are so many other similarly priced places in the area - no loyalty to return here. Not a very distinguishing experience either way - Standard big corporate hotel experience.	3.0
We had a very good stay at this hotel. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good. I had been worried about the breakfast because I had seen some reviews that hated the warm up eggs and breakfast sandwiches but I thought they were just fine and there were a few other good options. The only thing that sucks about the warm up sandwiches is the waste it makes. Itd be nice if the wrappings were recyclable.The only negative thing I would say is that the rooms are showing a need for a deep clean. There is dirt accumulating in the corners and soap scum on the shower shelves. The room in general was clean but definitely showed signs of cleanliness neglect if that makes sense. Location is excellent for two reasons. 1) central to all of the attractions which makes everything super walkable and 2) right across the street from Reading Terminal which was awesome!	4.0

I have never been a bite snob but I must say that St. Regis is starting to spoil me. The NY hire is superb and really adds to the stay. Other hotels in NY are so small and the St. Regis revamped its hotel and made all the rooms larger-and nicer. And it shows. Fruit is delivered each night. And not only do you get one piece of chocolate but an entire tray each night. It really got ridiculous because I just ate it all and it was really too much (work on the self control). Luckily they had a great work out room open 24 hours and I used it every evening. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. It is a rare opportunity for me to stay there and I took full advantage. The bottom line is if you get the chance, stay here. Anyone who says this hire is terrible should be banned from staying anywhere but their own home. The service is exceptional. I left a shirt at the hotel and they tracked it down for me and delivered it with personalized service. They literally made me feel that finding my shirt was the most important mission for the entire hotel staff. It is just a level of service rarely seen any more and entirely refreshing (as long as you don't mind the price).Dear JD, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent business trip to New York City and glad we were able to assist with tracking down your missing garment.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels upon which we pride ourselves. Thank you for taking the time to review our property on TripAdvisor, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.Warmly,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager	5.0
I can't say enough about the Suncoast!! My brother lives in Las Vegas, so as far as the Strip - we have been there, done that. If you are a first time visitor, then by all means, stay on the Strip if you want that Classic Las Vegas vibe. But if you frequent Las Vegas and would prefer a fabulous view of the mountains in Red Rock Canyon, no traffic and great value - then consider a stay at the Suncoast. We (my husband, myself and two children) have stayed there 4 times in the past few years and my parents stay there at least three times each year when they visit. You can't beat the low room rates, and the rooms are HUGE and very nice. The hotel has a large casino, friendly staff and a very nice selection of upscale restaurants, midrange restaurants, even a hot dog stand in the casino near the sportsbook. The pool and hot tub are very nice and never crowded. There is a movie theater and bowling alley. They also have a nightclub and on several occasions, my folks have enjoyed some great concerts at a very low ticket price. They saw the Lettermen and Jay and the Americans and raved about both shows.The only downside is the distance from the Strip - which is probably a 30 minute cab ride. But you are still close to shopping across the street at Tivoli Gardens, which also has some nice restaurants. If you want to explore Red Rock Canyon, do some hiking or horseback riding, or play golf, this would be a great place to stay. We have never had a bad time at Suncoast.	5.0
Hotel is clean, staff is friendly. Breakfast may be a hit or miss, guess depends on who is preparing the food. Depending on where your room is located you can end up with considerable noise from the traffic on 1604. Third stay at this hotel, two good stays and last one is so so. Believe they changed management recently as... More	3.0
My room was comfortable and very clean. The staff was very courteous, knowledgeable and exuded enthusiasm in regard to customer service. There were restaurants in the vicinity and it was easily accessible. I would definitely stay again.

First night was okay, there a band aid was in the pool, my gf pointed it out and we left to our room. Second night a water pipe burst causing water outage for the whole building and damaging their computer area. Our room and our friends adjacent room had ants in it. The phone in our room was not connecting to any inner hotel numbers so we couldn't have notified them of this issue or any medical emergency even if we wanted to using their phone system. When we left Sunday morning I notified the front desk of these issues and they said hotel GM would be calling me to try and rectify the situation. This never happened. After waiting a week I contacted the hotel for a refund for the one night and they informed me since I booked through Expedia I would have to contact them. After getting a hold of Expedia they contacted the hotel and were able to retrieve 1/2 of the cost of the night. I was amazed the hotel would not refund us our entire night considering the conditions of the rooms and lack of basic services. We could not go to the bathroom for the entire night (verified this at 10 PM, and again in the morning at 10 AM, the water in the toilets were backing up after one flush) and had to drive down to Chevron a few miles down the road to use their facilities and purchase drinking water. I can't even begin to comprehend how refunding half the night for these kind of inconveniences is fair to anyone who stayed during this time. I cannot recommend this place.	1.0
Very good service. Rooms were very clean. Servers and attendants were polite, courteous and very helpful. Comparing to the TULSA Ambassador (which I've stayed at many times), the style and architecture are different but the service is impeccable.	4.0
Great location ten min walk to bourbon/French quarter! The place is modern and funny and very clean. The staff is super friendly l. Stacy was very helpful and loved her energy. She helped us book a last min trip for the city/cemetery tour. You can tell she really likes what she does. Love the southern accent! I would def recommend this place!! YAY Stacy!! I will be sure to share your kudos with her as well as our entire staff. Thanks for choosing ALOFT NOLA for your stay, we hope to see you again on your next visit.Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations	5.0
included full breakfast had eggs (dried scrambled kind), sausage, potatoes, a Waffle Maker (yay) - on top of juices, yogurt, etc ... our Wireless Internet did not work in our room. The building layout was a little spooky, but the price was VERY reasonable, AND had free parking. This was a great value for 20 less than other Springfield hotels, and much less than staying in DC itself (with just 20min drive-time). I would stay here again.	3.0
The staff is friendly and accommodating without being ingratiating. The facility is clean and well maintained. The hotel is close to the highway and easy enough to find, though just a bit tucked away. This makes it a little unsettling to find the first time, but it makes it a quiet corner to get away.	5.0
Nothing to complain about Everything was fine and week with the price. It is very central in Boston and close to the public transportation.	5.0
We used 10,000 Marriott points for our stay in room 117. It was roomy, and had a massive closet. The room had a fridge, dishwasher, sink, stove, and expanding desk. (Yes, you could live there.)

The shuttle to the station wasn't always as available as implied, however it was quite an easy walk. If you have a UK mobile calling for the shuttle for a return trip from the station could be a problem but there were pay phones available. When we first went to our allocated room we were disappointed to have a brick wall just a few feet from the window. Upon request we were immediately moved to another room. The two minor problems we had with the room (safe and iron) were rectified quickly. In view of other comments we found the breakfast to be really disappointing and eventually decided to eat elsewhere. A car for a week is cheaper than a taxi to and from Dulles airport.	4.0
Good: All the staff was genuinely friendly.	5.0
Bad: The shuttle to Disney was not direct. Good: Polite and knowledgable staff , great lobby and breakfast .	5.0
As it was both of our birthdays and anniversary weekend we asked for an upper floor roorm, quiet, away from the street, in the back. All of our requests were granted. We had a 3rd floor room with a balcony in the back over the pool. Also, the housekeeping staff had made swans out of the towels in shape of a heart which was on our bed. This went way above and beyond. Thank you Melody and All of the BW staff for making our stay memorable. We will definetly be back.Thank you for the High Five! Melody is a great asset to our Hotel and we are glad you enjoyed the swans and your stay. Hope to see you again soon!	5.0

This is a low cost, low amenity place in rougher area - passable for a night or two. Wi-Fi was OK in room, but not secure. Free breakfast was good with hot and cold choices. Elevators - 1 not working long term, other was barely working, and was vvvvvveeeeerrrrrrrryyyyyyyy ssssslllllooooowwwww. Working one always went down to basement before coming up to first floor to take guests up their rooms ssssslllllooooowwwwwlllllyyyyy. Elevators need replacement - in really bad shape. Too small and buttons don't work. Bldg exterior, pool area need some investment. Lobby, breakfast area in OK shape. The hallways smell like smoke - seems like a roadway motor lodge out of the 70's. Who smokes anymore The rooms are fairly beat up, small beds, small no frill bath, no water pressure. Did have med size fridge and microwave tho.	3.0
We have stayed here twice in the last two years for 13 and 15 days respectively. Awesome location and facilities. The choice between the pools and the beach is always a tough one (life is hard).

If you're familiar with Key West, you'll recognize the location as the old Day's Inn. But the changes are more than just the signage. I figured it would be a new sign and fresh paint. Not so. A number of years back, numerous hotels on the entry end of the island were taken out of the inventory for revitalization, including the Days Inn. They gutted it, and the changes are significant.The room was large, as was the bath. Just a shower, no tub in room 148, which was fine. Bed was comfy, a/c worked great. In fact, I had no complaints at all about this property. The complimentary breakfast included pork sausage, turkey sausage, scrambled eggs, omelets, make your own waffles, plus pastries and fresh fruit. Not your typical complimentary breakfast.Pool is large enough, and plenty of lounges, as well as canopies. There's a Tiki Bar and music playing. Now for what may be a concern for some.The hotel is at the entry to the island. All traffic on or off the island passes through the intersection out front. Since the hospital is on Stock Island (just next to Key West) ambulances going there, pass right by. Sirens don't bother me, but if you get upset over them....well, since the island is 2 miles by 4 miles, maybe this isn't the place for you. There were numerous sirens from law enforcement, fire, and ambulances each day, but I didn't notice them at night.I had no complaints about this place. The only shortfalls, were that there was only one wastebasket in the room, which was next to the computer desk. Another in the bath would have been nice. Also, the parking spaces were a bit narrow, but nothing I couldn't deal with.Front desk and all staff were great. Property gets a recommended!Please note: There are two Fairfield Inns on the island. One at 2400 N. Roosevelt, and this one at 3800.Thank you for the very detailed review. We truly appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with our readers. Glad to hear you had time to enjoy our breakfast and enjoy some sun poolside. We look forward to welcoming you back to the Keys Collection!	4.0

I stayed here during my trip to DC on the Memorial Day weekend. I found this hotel very clean and comfortable. It is close to the Metro Station (5-10 min walk or 5 by cab) which is a big plus. Good neighbourhood. No Room service but lots of reasonable options to order from. Super nice room with kitchen. Didnt use much of the hotel services but found this place worth the money I spent. I didnt face any issues during my stay and would recommend this to my friends.	5.0

I came in late after a long drive from Vegas ending in a whole lot of highway exits and concentration to get to Napa! I was greeted by a friendly night staff who was expecting me, and (not sure of his name) made me feel more relaxed immediately. I even got a little welcome pack with a snack and water. That was much appreciated!Breakfast was not included, fruit and granola bars were out in the lobby. A hotel discount was offered at the friendly Denny's next door. My room was quiet and all 3 of the morning staff were incredibly helpful the next morning helping me map out my day of driving, and helping me choose and book my next hotels. The hotel is a convienent location, not too far off the main highway. Near all services and malls if needed.We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us and look foward to seeing you on your next visit to the Napa Valley!	5.0

Came up midweek for a quick break and an Orioles game, so did not spend much time in the hotel. But we were pleased with everything.

This hotel looks new and appears to have been newly updated. The breakfast area is very nice and has a homey feeling yet has a very contemporary style. The service at the front desk was speedy and very professional awesome reception with the friendliest staff. The rooms layout is very traditional going back to the older times. Even with some signs of upgrades, it felt to be a very old room. I think the dcor needed to be better and the appliances upgraded. The first thing I spotted entering the room was the throw pillow on the bed with what appears to be a large oil stain (hoping it is oil or grease) in the smack center of the pillow facing right at you. That sight alone made me think that the rooms upkeep was not up to par. I cannot understand why the pillow was even left for display in the room. The bathroom did not have a fan, showering in it created a very steamy room that made the rooms mirrors useless. Water pressure was awesome and the fixtures are all brand new. There was no complimentary bottled water in the room. There is no vending machine in the hotel however, there are candies for sale prominently displayed in the main lobby. The breakfast offered was good and plentiful. As I was getting ready for a biscuit, the lady refilling the biscuit tray rearranged the biscuits with her BARE hands and then with her BARE hands placed new biscuits into the tray. After seeing it, I changed my mind about having the biscuit.	2.0

We planned this stay as a Christmas gift to our children, 7 and 8 yr olds tk watch their first Colts game.I was so happy to not have to walk outside to get to the stadium s ok we didn't have to pack their winter coats all day.

The hotel is located across the street from the Space Needle. Its also within walking distance to Pike Place Market and other places along the wharf. The hotel is quiet. I never heard another person while in the room and virtually no street noise. Rooms are stylish and the beds are very comfortable. It has a mini kitchenette so if you there for a period of time it would be great. My only complaint is that the clocks in the room were still on Pacific Standard Time, not Daylight Savings. I did not notice this until the morning and was late for an appointment. I tried to change the clock but was not clear on the clock how to change the time. When I checked out I notified the desk that they should check the clocks in the rooms.David B,We are sincerely appreciative of your complimentary remarks on your experience at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown. I have shared your feedback with the team as we pride ourselves on the things we do right and how we can continually improve. Thank you for the feedback regarding the clock in your suite.

Granted the rooms in this hotel are not enormous but the high standard of service and spotlessly clean rooms make up for it. The location was perfect and the huge lounge area filled with computers that actually work was a great access. The front desk staff were charming living up to the reputation of customer service. The other great asset was the fact there was door located between the hotel and the restaurant next door. It rained one night during our stay so we were happy to take advantage of the restaurant which incidentally became our choice of breakfast venue as well.Dear JulieThank you so much for so many kind comments and observations.I am delighted that you had such an enjoyable stay with us and were well looked after. I am glad that you also enjoyed the Elephant Castle restaurant, it offers great value for money, service and very convenient opening hours - especially for the night owls.

My first time staying at a Best Western Plus and I was pleasantly surprised. The employees here are great and genuinely nice people always willing to assist. The rooms were clean and well kept and nicely appointed. The bed was comfortable and the bathrooms spacious and clean. It was also very convenient to have a Denny's restaurant within the hotel. The location of this hotel is also very good and on a main road with many shops and dining options. This place is good for an affordable family trip without sacrificing on quality.Jorge,Thank you for the great review.

Hermann is a charming town and a good location for our bike ride on the Katy trail. The Betty and Chuck were very gracious and accommodating. Their home is lovely and the bed was very comfortable. The location is perfect for a visit to Hermann	4.0
Really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend it to just about anyone. Loved the old Victorian ambiance and decor. The location was prime for us - we walked everywhere. Downsides are parking - had to park in the Commons garage but pretty walk back as long as it's not raining or snowing. And I really got the impression that a more traditional American bfast would be served but it was more like what you get at a chain hotel.	3.0
Very nice comfortable guest room. The beds are comfortable to the point of wanting to know what mattresses they use. You have the choice of firm or soft pillows-at least in the room we had. Quiet surroundings which help get a good nights sleep. Perfect getaway hotel in great location! Just off I-90 and Randall Rd. so its easy to... More	4.0
Neighborhood is quite dicey and not close to anything. The front desk clerk acted like I was bothering him when I checked-in and did not invite us to the complimentary afternoon happy hour or explain breakfast availablilty. The cleaning staff did a very good job when they bothered to show up. The room was beautiful and included full-size fridge, dishwasher, microwave and all the utensils and dishware that we could have needed. Washer and dryer for guest use on 1st floor. DOG friendly!	5.0
Stayed here for a conference(3rd time)and and it is a wonderful hotel. Clean, professional and great service. From the Web check in to the mobile check out and the state of the art rooms( all controlled by touch screen) I would recommend this hotel to all friends and colleagues.	5.0
The breakfast bar was wonderful, so many choices. The location was pretty good and they provide shuttle to Metro. The room was not great. The bathroom was clean, the beds were on the small side. The rest of the room seemed a bit outdated (but fine by me for the price). BIG DOWNFALL. Gum on two areas of the headboard. I do not know who puts gum on the top and side of the headboard, but I am more disturbed housekeeping did not see it to clean it up. Overall for the price compared to others it was pretty good.	3.0
From the moment we walked in we were treated like royalty! Every.Single.Time we came back from whatever we were doing,we were greater with hello and how are you!!! Beds were comfy,pillows were too. Rooms were spacious. If I had one complaint it would be that the air conditioning blew right on to the queen bed closest to it. My husband fixed that by sitting a chair directly in front of it.We did not eat breakfast there but I'd recommend another hour onto that 9:00 cutoff ) Hotel is close to EVERYTHING.We stayed here and drove the 25 miles to mammoth cave and it was well worth it. You sure can't beat the 77 dollars a night for the service and cleanness of this hotel. Thanks so much Bay Mont of Bowling Green for making the last half of our mini Vaca awesome!	5.0
Small hotel with very helpful, friendly staff. Light, airy hallways with fruit bowls in the lobbies. Good breakfast at the restaurant next door. Very comfortable. Parking available across the street. Easy access by car to Marin Headlands for memorable views of the Golden Gate Bridge.	4.0
I really enjoyed my stay here for one night. The room was large and very comfortable, with a kitchenette (fridge, coffee machine, microwave, sink), desk and living room.

It's a clean place with friendly service. The bed was amazing.

Our holiday stay at the NOPSI was PERFECT! The hotel and the architecture are spectacular. The staff, from housekeeping to management, was professional, efficient, polite and friendly. The service was just as one would expect from a luxury hotel. I can't say enough about the bartenders at all 3 bars. They were knowledgeable mixologists, friendly and efficient. The view from the rooftop bar is grand and so is the atmosphere. The lobby bar is beautiful and the live music in the evenings was a wonderful treat. Room service was delivered quicker than anticipated and was delicious! Our breakfasts were first class! The 3 egg omelet Pontchartrain, Porchetta Hash and Eggs, Pecan Belgian Waffles and 1/2 Ruby Grapefruit Brle were the best room service meals I believe my husband and I have ever had for breakfast. The room service wait staff was polite and friendly. Although we did not dine at Public Service during this stay, we have in the past and found the food and service to be exemplary. Christmas morning we were greeted with a stocking hanging on our door. The stocking was filled with fresh fruit, candy and baked goods. What a wonderful surprise! The accommodations were beautiful and comfortable. My husband is generally very uncomfortable sleeping in hotel beds and lounging on hotel furniture, but he was very comfortable during our stay at the NOPSI. He was so pleased, that he has already booked the hotel for a return business trip in the near future. Love this beautiful hotel in my favorite city! Can't wait to return.Sharon, Thank you for sharing your wonderful review on TripAdvisor. I am thrilled that you enjoyed a little lagniappe on Christmas morning as well as phenomenal service throughout your stay. It is an honor to be your hotel of choice in New Orleans. Our team looks forward to welcoming you again on your next visit. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager	5.0
We enjoyed our stay at the Shore hotel, though feel it doesn't represent good value, particularly the 1 bed suites which are quite small. Overall the facilities are a bit limited and restaurant wasn't operating during our stay. Great location for 3rd street promenade and accessing the pier, though not for the beach itself. Staff were great, particularly Jonah and... More	3.0
We were passing through Erie for one night on our family vacation. This hotel served its purpose just fine.

Front desk staff was so nice - very accommodating and welcoming. Room was great - balcony to the courtyard, comfortable furniture, big bathroom with his/hers sinks was very convenient for getting ready quick. The pool/hot tub area and outdoor fireplace was really enjoyable - we used it all 3 days we stayed. There's even a Starbucks on site, and a Kinko's which was nice for some things we needed to quickly print off. I would definitely stay again when visiting Orlando.	4.0

The hotel was beautiful and although it has only been there 8 months I was very pleased with my stay. I felt the hotel was understaffed the weekend I was there which caused check in to be delayed and my room was not ready when I arrived.	4.0
When we checked in, we had no toiletries due to the strict airline restrictions from Canada, so the clerk at the front desk took care of everything for us with complimentary necessities. We were also given a complimentary appetizer for their restaurant, and were informed that daily happy hours was between 5:30 - 7:30 pm. Our room was really nice, clean and comfortable with updated furnishings. A little more attention to detail could have been made with the cleaning reagarding some marks and soiling on the walls, but nothing to complain about. After having spent over 30 hours travelling, we were very pleased to find that happy hour consisted of our choice of a long list of spirits, beer, and wine (unlimited), as well as tortilla chips, salsa and guacamole - all complimentary. A full breakfast buffet is included, which is as good as anywhere we've ever been. Sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs, hashbrowns, milk, juice, tea, coffee, bagels, toast, english muffins, sweet buns, fruit, yogurt, and made to order omlette. Lunch and supper in the restaurant was also really good. Some of the best wings I've ever had.	4.0

Bad: Main Street Station recently implemented paid parking (I stayed last week and it was still free). Although parking is free for hotel guests, they have not worked the kinks out of the system.

The rooms were clean, well air-conditioned and large, with good bathrooms, basic cable TV and wireless Internet access. There's also a computer in the reception area. The desk service was very helpful and polite. There's a medium-sized outdoor pool. The complimentary breakfast includes many items, and you can make your own waffles. There is a shuttle bus until 10 pm to the metro stop, which is the last stop on the line. It takes 30-45 minutes to get to the center of Washington. The shuttle can fill up, and can take a while to pick you up. We did find parking at the metro stop lot, but that can fill up.	4.0

We arrived in town at 10am, and asked if we could check in early. We realized we were very early, but hoped we could check in before 3pm. We were told we could not check in early, even though the place was almost a ghost town (there were 3 cars in the parking lot (including ours), and I wondered if the other two belonged to the workers. When we came back at 4:30pm to check in, we were told we would need to get a second room as we had 2 teenagers (plus mom dad) and 3 toddlers. We asked if our toddlers could sleep in a pack n play or on the floor. They said no, so we asked for a refund, so we could make arrangements to stay somewhere that would be more accommodating. They refused to give us a refund, and called the cops. The cops arrived a few minutes later. After hearing both sides, the cops asked the hotel to give us a refund, but the hotel refused. After an hour and fifteen minutes, we agreed to stay there for that night and find another hotel for the next night, but still no refund was provided. To top it off, the hotel was terribly dirty and run down. The pool area needs to be painted as you can see the concrete all over. The room was dirty. This was our worst hotel experience ever.	1.0

Booked a combo deal through Southwest, excellent value, very nice hotel. Clean rooms, quite, polite staff. Little smokey in the casino but you can get away from that. The gym was nice and they have a excellent restaurant Javier's a must go to place. Rooms are also fully automated, very cool.	5.0

Very good hotel, but the close proximity to the toll highway made it a little on the noisy side. ps Why does Chicago, or is it Illinois, charge 1.90 for the toll road and not 2.00 Just seemed odd to someone from a land with no toll roads.	4.0

Good location, nice place.... but make sure to avoid the travel desk upon arrival, they only push (hard) to make you attending 2 hour presentation against free breakfast, selling or promoting Whyndham club .

Really great hotel, good breakfast buffet and I loved the fact they had a stairway going down to the beach area... And the view of the Ocean was fantastic. The only unfortunate thing was the weather wasn't in our favor to enjoy the hot tub and fire pits. I'll be back	5.0
Bad: I didn't like that check-in 'begins' at 4pm. You check in and wait for them to call you when your room is ready. Ours was ready at 6p. This was more of a plain hotel, not like a 'Vegas' hotel. Food, entertainment, and 'gambling' were limited. This is the best spot to be AWAY from Vegas while IN Vegas...if that's what you're looking for. Good: All amenities were top of the line.	4.0
I was pleasantly surprised by my visit. After arriving in NYC, I noticed that I booked the wrong Four Seasons. It was my intention to stay at the Four Seasons close to Central Park. However, the services at the Four Season Downtown location exceeded my expectations. They were able to provide check-in for an early arrival (11:00 am) to a spacious, clean beautiful room. The breakfast provided through room-service was delicious (you must try the truffle scramble eggs). My dinner at the Cut was outstanding. This is an exceptional addition to the Financial Area.	5.0
The suite was very spacious and the amenities were good. The living room has comfortable chairs, a roomy couch/convertible bed, and an adequate dining area. The bedroom made sleeping easy and pleasurable. Although the hotel's fitness room is sparse the pool and spa are delightful with its glass ceiling and walls providing great views of the surrounding foliage. I also enjoyed the complementary full breakfast with eggs made to order. I will definitely return to this hotel.	5.0

Room was clean and comfortable. Friendly staff. Convenient location. Good place for families, couples, or business travelers. Did miss not having a workout facility, though not a big deal.

What an experience....... Old on the outside.....New modern on the inside. Our room was Small but when in the keys you don't spend a lot of time in the room. First class service. Valet Parking which you need if u stay downtown. There is a 30 fee for parking but it's worth it. The reception room is very unique and the bar is beautiful. It does have a pool and gardens are beautiful. It's close to Malery park to watch sunsets and is by all the restaurants and bars.Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us.

Great hotel in the heart of Union Square at a very reasonable rate. We were attending an event at ATT park and Earlier that day we devided to stay in the SF overnight. The Marquis had rooms available, at a great rate and close to ATT (9.00 UBER ride). The hotel is beautiful and our room was immaculate. Staff is very friendly and kind. The only negative was on the day of our arrival, we waited on Mission Street for an hour to have valet park our car. The valet attendants were very apologetic and the desk clerk upon hearing how long it took, gave us an early check-in. I would most definitely stay here again!	4.0
I have told the Westin I am going to leave honest feedback on my experience and will do so. First, the hotel is beautiful. Guests commented on the amazing and historic beauty it had to offer. Rooms are a bit pricey, but comparable to other hotels in downtown Greenville. In fact,... Read More rooms in the room block here were cheaper than what other hotels were going to offer in blocks. The complimentary night for the wedding was an added plus. We had our reception in the Gold Ballroom and that, too, was a great location site. It was stunning and if you want a reception in a ballroom, I wouldn't have anything negative to say about it. I caution you if you plan on solely relying on the hotel's event planner. While she sets up everything for you (or instructs the staff, I'm not entirely sure), I still had a day of coordinator and do not regret that choice one bit. My DOC had to fix the centerpieces since they did not match the pictures provided. Also, my DOC was present through the ENTIRE reception. The hotel's planner typically does not stay until the end of the reception and also was not there Sunday during our departure to help us locate some of our items. The hotel's planner is not consistently present during the reception, especially if there is another wedding or event in the hotel. She is present only here and there, but not consistently. We had an issue with our champagne toast and had to send my DOC to try to locate the hotel's planner or anyone to help. Overall, the hotel's planner was useful in organizing the details, planning food, etc. She ensured the timeline generally flowed and we got to where we needed to be. At times, communication was hard and responses to questions were delayed. The overall package price, in my opinion, was helpful. Next, we had issues with the clean up of the event, which is part of the package. The staff told my DOC they were not going to pack up the reception decor, which resulted in my DOC, father, and several groomsmen spending an hour or two packing up the items and then carrying them to my father's room. As the hotel planner was not there at the end of the reception, there was no one to talk to about what was happening. Needless to say, the end result was a DOC I needed to compensate for time outside our contract and a not very pleased Father of the Bride. After some pressing to the Westin, compensation was given for this. I can at least give them credit for rectifying a wrong though it did take some pushing. For reception food, it was fantastic. We had many compliments on the steak, sides, etc. The staff was attentive and the bar service was quick. My father had lots of positive things to say about the staff and especially liked Eric. Eric is a jack of all trades - he was the bartender at the rehearsal, bell hop at various points, waiter at the reception, van driver on Sunday. If you have Eric doing anything, you are in good hands. We also had a fantastic server, JJ, at the wedding - we loved her, too. The Westin suggested doing wine passing during dinner and closing the bar as a cost saver. In the end, this was more expensive than simply doing another hour for the open bar. You are charged taxes, gratuity, and services fees for this hour though the contract states this is part of the package; this was an issue and I'm still not in agreement that it was right since it was never mentioned. Think twice about this option. Most of our decor was returned - a few items were missing.	3.0
I really enjoyed my stay at the Norwalk Inn. The room was beautiful and the staff was so helpful. There was a great restaurant where we had a wonderful family meal. I would definitely give a five-star rating to this hotel. Hoping to come again soon!	5.0
Very clean room. Good breakfast. Extremely friendly and helpful front desk staff. The swimming pool is tiny and outdoors, but we didn't use it anyway. This is the best hotel in Jackson TN. We will stay here again.	5.0

My wife, teenage son and I stayed in a 2 bedroom suite at the hotel between Sunday 10/07/16 and Thursday 14/07/16. On arrival the receptionist was very friendly and professional.

Bad: The staff were not professional. The reception staff who helped me checking in was dressed like being at home. She looked very tired and communicated with me without any expression on her face. My bathroom was a disaster. It became a swimming pool after I used it each time. BTW, the real swimming pool was closed for the seasonal reason. Good: The staff were helpful. The bed is comfortable. The location is just in the very center of the main tourism avenue.	3.0
I'm just being honest here. We booked this hotel because we were traveling with our two dogs on our way to FL. The lobby seemed nice but if you have a dog with you, you are sent around to the very back to the C building. There is so much construction going on that the back parking lot is extremely... More	3.0

Booked over the phone. Asked if they were pet friendly and the lady said yes. Drove 5 hours to get here and then be told no cats allowed. Would not cancel nor refund the reservation. Called my bank to stop payment and dispute the charge. Very unfriendly staff. Not a good experience	1.0
I would highly recommend staying at this hotel. The rooms are spacious and highly accommodating. The hotel is clean. The food market located directly across the street is very interesting and they have anything you could possibly be craving. The coffee downstairs is free with to-go cups and it's actually delicious.Dear barbieann12,I would like to thank you for choosing the Home2 Suites by Hilton Philadelphia for your recent stay.

Unacceptable, unprofessional behavior.1. Couldn't get into room because I wasn't on the reservation. 2. Person let into room who wasn't on the reservation.3. Unreliable housekeeping.4. Double-charged for entire stay... WHEN I WASN'T EVEN ON THE RESERVATION.So, to begin... My friend PREPAID with her card for a room for us to share, but requested that my name be added to the reservation since I would arrive in NOLA hours before her. There's a whole email trail to prove they agreed, had my name spelled correctly, etc. I arrived, and they're like who are you I'm tired. I've been traveling. I need to shower, but no. I can't get into the room until hours later when my friend lands and gets it sorted from her Uber. I check us in using my card for incidentals, saying they'd only put a 50 hold on my card if we charged something to the room (we didn't). My friend arrives three hours later, but basically gets into our room about 15 minutes after I do. Once she's there, she tells me a pretty funny story. Her bf and his friends had another room, and even though he never put them on the reservation at all, they gave them keys! I had documentation and couldn't get into my room, and they, complete strangers for all the hotel knows, just waltzed into theirs! A huge security issue!The room itself was nice enough, and so was the pool however, the pool bar closed at random times despite having official posted hours. The bartenders were rude, as was most of the hotel staff (except for the doormen, who were delightful). Our room was only cleaned half the days of our stay. Housekeeping didn't replenish the toiletries when they did clean the room, and with two women, we obviously ran out of shampoo. When we called the front desk, around 10pm, they said they'd run out! At 11pm they came with a bag (and I mean garbage bag) full of.... lotion Because that helps. So both my friend and I showered without washing our hair, only to have housekeeping show up again at 2AM IN THE MORNING, banging on the door, with one bottle of shampoo that I guess they found. Not only was it late, but it was LATE.And now the worst part, to top it all off: Remember when I wasn't even on the reservation Yeah, they charged my credit card on file for a temporary hold FOR THE ENTIRE STAY. After my friend HAD ALREADY PREPAID. They got their before we even stepped in the door, and then double charged a completely different credit card with a completely different name. Yeah, no. You can deal with my credit card company thanks. I'm giving them two stars instead of one because the doormen were so incredibly nice. The nicest I've ever met. They should all get bonuses.And some additional minor points:Doormen: SO NICE! I LOVED THEM!Housekeeping: Good job cleaning WHEN they cleaned (but didn't restock soaps)Pool: Small but really nice, great viewBars: Rude, closed for no reasonFood: GreatBed: ComfortableBathroom: AwesomeNoise level: LOUD but it's not the soundproofing. It's the crazy loud fan/vent.Location: GREATOverall cleanliness: GREATThank you for taking a moment to share your review on TripAdvisor. Your candid feedback is truly valuable. I am disappointed to learn of issues you encountered during your stay as well as the service that should have been executed flawlessly. My apologies for your experience and I hope you will allow us another opportunity to serve you. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager	2.0
The hotel was located close to Gwinnett Center and restaurants. The price was very reasonable considering it had: large refrigerator, flat screen TV, internet and microwave. I have stayed at other hotels that cost more but did not have these features.	4.0
This hotel is a reasonably good place to stay if you want to visit the Napa Valley. Our room was clean and pleasant, the staff members we encountered were helpful and professional, and the price we paid for our room (during December of 2014) was reasonable. However, potential guests should be aware that, according to information we were given by a staff member, rates may be different during the summer.Thank you for your review. I am glad you enjoyed your stay and the service we provided. Yes the summer rates are higher, but we are still one of the most reasonably price hotels during that time of year. Hope to see you again.	4.0

This hotel was a bit older but very well maintained. The room was spacious with a separate full kitchen and a walk-in closet. There was zero noise from elevators or guests above or next door, unlike many newer hotels we've stayed in. Our only complaint was that the place was a bit difficult to find after dark - the sign is not high enough to be easily visible. In daylight, we discovered it was extremely easy to travel right next door to the Arlington Cemetary or across the Arlington Bridge to the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, etc. The price was very reasonable and we would definitely stay here again.	5.0
Bad: We had the bad luck of staying in a room next to a suite. Our neighbors partied until 5 am. Good: Room and common areas were very nice.	5.0

This Hampton Inn provides the usual predictable quality. Building is quite old. Breakfast area is very small. Exercise room is a converted former guest-room. Single piston-driven elevator is slow.

My husband, baby daughter and I really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. You are in a great location near all the restaurants and shops and you cannot beat the price! The beds were not the best quality but were comfortable. I liked the fact there was a microwave and mini fridge in the room. It is not the fanciest hotel to stay in but it met our immediate needs and was very accomodating for a weekend trip getaway with my family. The gentleman at the front desk was very friendly and courteous too. When we return to the area we will come back to this hotel.	4.0
Nice to visit one of the old time motels (motor-hotels) which were the only type of lodgings found along the smaller highways of North America during the 50's and 60's before the interstates and bigger hotel chains came in and destroyed the tourist economies of America's small towns.

The staff was very nice and accommodating. Love the happy hour and breakfast option. The outside area is nice. Lobby good. Rooms just a little cheapish, but ok. Bed comfortable. Bedding clean. Like the coffee and cookies in the lobby.	4.0
We visit every year for wine tasting. The Richland Courtyard by Marriot is always a excellent experience. The rooms on the ground floor are especially nice with high ceilings. The riverside views are nice, but I prefer the other side as there is some traffic noise from the highway bridge, even though it's quite a distance away.	5.0
My boyfriend and I were taking a road trip to Las Vegas (starting in MI), and we planned to stop in Chicago for a night. I found this hotel online and after seeing the location as well as the price, I was sold. When we arrived, the valet personnel were extremely helpful. They gave us a map to where we could self-park if we weren't interested in using valet, which was only about 2 blocks away. While he parked, I had someone assist me with our bags. They were quick and very friendly, telling me all the things we should do during our short stay. When I got to the room, everything was nice and clean, and though previous reviews say that the room is too small, I found that it was just what we needed for a night. The bed was comfortable, there was enough room to put our multiple bags/suitcases. The bathroom was very clean and the shower had a hand-held shower head, which was nice. We were visiting family that evening, so we wanted to bring a dessert to them. We asked (who I believe was) the manager there where the nicest/closest bakery was, and he told us about Magnolias. The desserts were incredible, a very good recommendation. The next morning, we ordered room service for breakfast from the restaurant downstairs because we were too comfy to even get out of bed. The food was brought up very quickly and was not too expensive at all, plus it was delicious. The only downside to the stay was that you have to pay for parking once again if you choose to leave and come back. However, everything else was great. There is a Starbucks right next door as well as several shopping stores within walking distance. The hotel staff that we had the pleasure of interacting with were all very kind and helpful. We will definitely be coming back for our next trip to Chicago.	5.0

Not up to HHonors standards. Beautiful property, nice rooms and bath room nice clean carpets and bedding / bed comfort. But, NO HOT WATER for 25 minutes - each morning. Yes, we were told to wait 20+ minutes for the hot water to get up to the room level. And, the internet didn't connect, so we (my traveling partner - in another room) had to use the 'staff' WiFi with their password.Thank you for taking the time to share this feedback and we do apologize for not meeting expectations during your recent stay. I will review all aspects of design and address accordingly to ensure our guests enjoy their time as our guests. The boiler at our hotel did experience a mechanical issue that we addressed as quickly as possible but this did however cause our guests to experience no hot water for a period of time. Please know that this was not due to anything other than bad luck and timing. Our boiler is very new and plenty big enough for our hotel, this was an isolated issue that has been corrected moving forward. We are however happy to hear that you felt safe and secure while staying with us and do hope to have you back as our guests the next time you travel to New Orleans. Sincerely,	2.0

This hotel could use upgrading. It is clean enough, but truly bare bones. Of greater concern was the mandatory destination fee of 9.95 per day that tacked on the bill. There was no option to decline it, and I was not informed ahead of time. In essence, it adds 10 to the room charge. I booked this hotel because the price seemed reasonable. But at 10 more per day, I could have stayed at a nicer hotel for the same price.	3.0
Perfect place if you are looking for a more reasonable (quieter and not so expensive) place to stay. The best part of the hotel is that it is on the beach and boardwalk.

Great place. Bed was firm, room was clean and convenient for what we needed it. A bit small but... Can't believe what they offer is considered breakfast.

I gave this a 'this room is great for free wifi and sightseeing' review because there wasn't an option for absolutely nothing. We did have wifi, and we got to see a few drug deals in the parking lot, so that could qualify as sightseeing. The room itself was acceptable, the beds were clean, however, they should rethink their free pet policy as our room had ticks, and so we left, after being there two hours. The pictures on hotels.com are NOT pictures of this hotel. The staff was amazing...refunded our money, very apologetic, absolutely outstanding customer service.	1.0

Bad: The last night there was a prom. I guess one of the parties decided to continue in to the night next door. Loud talking and slamming of the doors,up until 3 am.

Extremely pleased with our hotel stay. We are a family of 5 and recently spent 2 nights at this hotel. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of our suite and the friendliness of the staff. There is a popcorn machine in the lobby, which my kids loved. We also caught the staff setting out warm chocolate chip cookies in the evenings-YUM! Such a nice homey touch! The free breakfast was outstanding. We traditionally don't expect much from a hotel spread, but this one was the exception. Lots of selections, and the hot options changed from one morning to the next. Breakfast attendant was friendly and helpful, and kept everything well stocked as the crowd ebbed and flowed. The only negatives were an extremely loud family in the room above us that kept us awake until almost midnight. The hotel staff did they best to help and even offered to move us, but we opted not to take them up on the offer. Nothing else the staff could have done to help that situation. I was also disappointed that the hot tub wasn't working, but the kids had a wonderful time in the pool regardless.	5.0

My husband and I had to stay at this hotel for one night. I have never been to such a terrible place. I have been to the 3rd world countries, but have not seen such a shabby room. The room was disgusting (although the sheets seemed clean). The furniture had spots, tear, and looked like it was picked up off the curb. Nightstands and table had cigarette burns on them. The most terrible thing was that the room reeked of nicotine! I had a hard time sleeping because of the smell. When I got home I had to wash all my clothes. No one should stay in this hotel, unless for punishment! This hotel is a 4-floor building and the elevator is not working, which seems permanent. There is is no phone in the room, so if we had a problem, we needed to go downstairs and then back up.	1.0
Good points: Had type of room we needed, 2 beds with pull-out sofa, newly remodeled-actually still in process on higher floor, nice breakfast selection, keeps coffee available all day Bad points: Our first assigned room was newly remodeled based on decor and bedding but TV wouldn't work with remote and several small pieces of food stuck to wall by trashcan,...

This is a nice little hotel with a great view overlooking a small marina. Nice rooms and inexpensive. Free parking. No reception staff after 7PM but they will leave you a key to your room. A bit outside Clearwater but some nice restaurants close by. Definitely a good place to stay if you have access to a car.	4.0
Good: Breakfast	2.0

We had another excellent vacation at Honua Kai. I looked around at the competitors - Westin / Sheraton / Marriott, but renting a Honua Kai condo through VRBO is still a considerable savings. It's a little further away from the action around Whalers' Village but we really didn't want to spend much time doing that anyways. There is a shuttle... More	5.0
The hotel was old but fairly well maintained. I would not call it a 4 star hotel. Our problem had to do with the shuttle pick up after a day of being at Summerfest.

My husband and teenage daughter stayed here for a quick trip to Atlanta recently. We were hoping that we would have been wowed, but it was just ok.

Hello. I stood at this woodspring suites for two weeks. While I was there and I had a great stay. When I walked in the the lobby to check in the manager and the general manager greeted me with kindness and it felt really good. When I got to my room, the room felt very clean. I stood at this hotel due to work. I will be returning shortly and I will also tell my other co-workers to stay there. Thank you for a great stay.We are so glad our staff was able to make your time at WoodSpring Suites a great one. The WoodSpring Suites team strives to make your stay one you wont forget.

The hotel was very nice. As compared to several other Casinos on the strip the Aria casino had the least offensive smell of cigarettes. The buffet was good but pricey.

I was please to see how close the hotel was to Kings Dominion (across the street) and a Denny's right next door. The good points ended there, however. Upon entering the room, we noticed lots of white hairs on the floor, so we requested that the floor be vacuumed. I requested a rollaway and we started to set it up after we came back from the amusement park. When I opened it, I found a blood stain on the mattress cover. The front desk was alarmed by the finding, but suggested we cover it with sheets (really). I had them take it away, so my little cousin ended up sleeping in the chair. Much later that night, the toilet was stopped up, but maintenance was to busy to fix it, so a plunger was delivered for us to do it. The toilet kept running the entire night. The following morning the toilet overflowed, so we weren't able to shower and we checked out. Each incident was reported to the front desk and we received a 20 discount, which was unsatisfactory given all of the issues encountered. Hotels.com helped to resolve the issue. Thank you Hotels.com! I would never stay at this location again. I would rather drive a few more miles to get the amusement park, than have the convenience of being close yet sacrifice great service.	1.0
I was satisfied for choosing Best Western. I try to always choose a Best Western because of there cost/ benefits of stay comparison. I feel that I get what I pay for and it is reasonable. I didn't expect a pool, so that was a surprise that I was grateful for, as well as my son.	4.0
Upon arriving I see modern yet elegant decor which is pleasing to the eye. The front staff are very friendly.

Very new. Very clean. I recommend staying there if visiting Baltimore or the surrounding area. It was a 10-15 minute drive to Baltimore from the hotel. Great price per night. The neighborhood is all hotels with a Wendy's and Bob Evans near by. I'll stay here next time I'm in the area.	5.0
Bad: Very old hotel. Front desk not very pleasant, never smiled! Isn't that their job description Happily welcome guests as the hotel ambassadors. They just talked amongst themselves. Breakfast was obviously cheap unfrozen. Nothing FRESH, except old fruit overly-processed waffle mix. Tub was gross towels had hair stuck to it. Very small front desk/common/breakfast area, pictures are decieving. Good: Location was amazing, next to easiest Magic Kingdom entrance! Room was clean enough. Choice hotels update done, TVs, bedspreads... The building is very pretty, not cookie cutter. We didn't use pool, gym nor office but pictures looked okay.	3.0
Although check-in was a bit long (new girl at desk by herself on a Saturday afternoon), the room was clean, comfortable and had nice amenities.

Bad: Breakfast. Good: Excellent family enjoyed everything. Staff friendly and helpful. Arrived early gave phone number and they called when room was ready 2 hours before check in. Location wonderful for us, we walked every where. Direct access to beach. Outside pool great, food there was good too and not to pricey. Overall great stay. Well worth the price. U get what u pay for. Breakfast could have been a lil better, my personal opinion.	5.0

We stayed for 6 nights in Cabin 5. It was more spacious than it looked on the website photographs. It did not feel crowded or squished. And the reading room was cute--nice place to sit quietly.

For the price and name, I expected better. The mattress was old and hard, as were the towels. The water pressure fluctuated and was poor. Extra coffee was brought upon request but without cream and sugar. It was overpriced for what you got. However, the staff was good and kind.	2.0

Bad: Some of the front desk staff came off a bit rude. This is a nicer hotel, and we just felt like since we don't always dress fancy - after all, we were on vacation and out and about all day, every day - that we were looked down upon. We aren't fancy people but wanted to spoil ourselves for our anniversary. Good: We loved the location and the style of the hotel and the rooms. Caesar at the door was extremely welcoming and helpful.	5.0
If you're looking for the grand ole lobby type place like you stayed with your granny, this ain't it.

Check-in is friendly and efficient and if you... More	5.0
This hotel gets the job done. It gives you a place to sleep... that is, unless the staff decide to give your room to someone else, like they did during my stay. Imagine my surprise as I lounged on the bed with my fiance watching TV when someone unlocked our room door and walked in with her luggage! Of course that meant we had to reset our keys. The hotel also gives you a decent breakfast the night after your stay. Unfortunately each of the juice containers dispense juice along with black residue that settles in the bottom of your cup, so you'll probably want to stick with one of the two hot tea options. Try to get a room on the upper floors, as there was a religious concert of some sort complete with electric guitars and full drum set on the bottom floor at 8:30 am Sunday morning. If you're trying to relax in your room after waking up, beware that it might not be that tranquil as the cleaning women yell at each other down the hallway for about 45 mins-1 hr as they clean your floor.	2.0
My wife and I decided to try it because of the previous three reviews, they were new to Expedia and it was a great price for room.

The hotel is situated in the perfect spot for all the attractions, and within walking distance of most of them. The hotel was clean and just right for what we wanted, nothing too flashy, not overly expensive and very clean. We had a great view and could see the top of the Empire State Building from our window. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. The Subway was just around the corner and there were plenty of places to eat. Our stay at The Chelsea Savoy hotel was a happy one, we would definitely stay there again.	5.0

Hotel outdoor pool looked much larger on the website and appeared to be oceanfront.

This is a unique property in that they combined a Hilton Garden Inn with a Homewood Suites (Also by Hilton).

Since I was meeting a friend coming in at Midway, and being able to shop at the mall right next door, and eat at an IHOP, also right next door in that mall... Everything to make that weekend easy and fun was close at hand.Plus I had to remind myself where I was when I woke up each morning, because the bed was firm, like my own bed at home, so I was very comfortable.	5.0
We arrived in the Columbus area very late in the evening/early morning without a reservation thinking we would be able to find a room. Unfortunately, that was not the case.

Stay in Howard Johnson Inn is a good deal I can find over the Internet around University of Delaware -- Newark area. However, (1) the breakfirst is too simple, not good. (2) One night there was no hot water. (3) Another night there was no Internet connection. (4) they charge early check-in for some $40, that is not friendly. I hope the boss of the hotel can improve their service further and provide kind service. But I thank Hotels.com rewards me a night stay for free.	4.0

For some reason according to the front desk the regular queen room booked from Hotels.com gave us a handicap room. I stayed at a wonderful Red Roof Inn in Boston a few years ago. Since then i have been to 2 in Pennsylvania. It is definitely not the same. Won't be staying at red roof again	1.0

Our stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel was amazing! I read one review that didn't understand why this hotel had such good ratings. Well, he must be used to spending 200+ per night for a hotel room, or never traveled to Hawaii. Hotels with this location are often 300+ per night. The reviewer mentioned it being in need of a remodel. Well, unfortunately for those of us used to watching how we spend our money, they are remodeling the hotel and the rooms look awesome!!! They look nicer than the Arizona Biltmore and Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona if you have been there. (I had only worked there and got the view the rooms, as I could not afford to spend 400+ per night.) So, when the rates are higher, and in line with the majority of the other hotels, that reviewer should be happy because the new rooms are truly gorgeous. People pay for gorgeous. They are the most modern beautiful hotel rooms I have ever seen.We actually felt lucky to get to stay there before the major remodel. The location is so close to the beach and downtown activities. We could walk to all kinds of wonderful things to do and see. Diamond Head was our view out our bathroom window. I would recommend spending the extra 15 or so per night for the ocean view. So, it wasn't fancy, but it was fun and helped us be able to save quite a bit of money. The bed was comfortable, the ocean breeze was to die for, and we couldn't have asked for more in that price range. I also have to recommend a corner room if you get lucky to have a cross-breeze of ocean air.However, what made it the most wonderful stay was the staff. We were treated like family from the moment we arrived. We never felt so cared for in a hotel. The friendly, caring and attentive staff made it a 5 star hotel in our eyes. We cannot wait to go back and see all the friends we made there. If on a budget get in on the older rooms before they are remodeled. If you have the extra money, get an amazing remodeled room, you won't be dissappointed.	5.0

My second cousin was getting married on the beach a short walk from this hotel, so I was very happy to find this place at a discounted price on the week of the trip. The hotel was fine overall but there were some small things that bugged me: * The beds were squeaky * The towels were scratchy * Some machinery within a locked area in the bathroom was running and making a lot of noise RIGHT next to the wall between the bathroom and the bedroom, next to the bed where my wife and I slept. It didn't keep me up at night, but it was noticeable. Some good things to make sure you don't think it was all bad: *The hotel's restaurant, Tradewinds, had great food, and it provided good room service AND it was the first time I'd seen room service at a reasonable price. *The hotel is right on the beach, and since it's not in the crowded part of VA beach shore, there's not so many other people to deal with. Also, the hotel is on the shore of VB that is in the Chesapeake Bay, so the water is much calmer than the beach along Atlantic Avenue something to consider if you have young children.	3.0
Stayed here twice in the past 2 weeks. Accessible room both times. First the bad - I called the hotel within 45 minutes of checking out - very early morning. I realized I had left my ring on the table next to the bed and asked if they could please check on it immediately. They promised to call me back - they never did. Due to my early checkout and my prompt call, I doubt the cleaning staff had even entered the room. So, I'm very unhappy about the ring - nothing overly expensive, but it did have some sentimental value.Accessible rooms themselves were much more adequate than most - we have a lot of experience in this area, and many accessible rooms are NOT truly accessible. For our second stay we were given a room that was on the top floor and the furthest room from the elevator. In an emergency, we would have never gotten out of that hotel. My husband is in a wheelchair. There is no way we would have made it down 9 flights of stairs, and trying to get 2 children and a manual wheelchair to the elevator was tiring and difficult. WHY don't hotels use a little common sense and realize that accessible rooms on LOWER floors would be more logical We were offered no assistance with luggage either stay.A huge plus for this hotel is that they are one of the very few hotels in Philadelphia that offer 2 Queen beds in a room. However, I was told by the front desk staff that none of the Queen rooms face the street. So, the windows in these rooms basically face other 'inside' rooms and offer very little light. The hotel is fairly new, so the rooms do not have the tired and worn appearance that many hotels in Philadelphia do.Location for this hotel is very good. Very close to Jefferson University Hospital, Chinatown, Magee Rehabilitation hospital, restaurants, city hall, etc. Breakfast leaves a lot to be desired, but then again, yogurt, cereal, juice, beats 40+ for a family breakfast at a restaurant each day. I would do away with the microwave items altogether though.Price was very good, location great. While they could have done better in several areas, we plan to stay again.	4.0
Steve the Bartender was very knowledgable about the local area and he had many restaurants to recommend, so many local restaurants to us, it was so hard to choose from.

Good location, nice room, but that's it. No atmosphere, impersonal, not really interested front desk, chaotic and hilarious, above all poor and hardly any choice breakfast, a room with a view of an office building at 20 meter distance (privacy), room cleaned at 17.00 after our request, not a real clean room, found even 2 cockroaches on our bed when we went to sleep, no safe in the room.

The Fairfield Inn Suites Key West at The Keys Collection in Key West, was a clean hotel, a little out of Key West. There was a shuttle into Key West proper, but it was crowded do to other hotels in the same area give the shuttle free as a perk, at the Fairfield Inn it was 20/ day/ room. We did some things on the side of the island that the Inn on. Key West Botanical Garden, and Lazy Dog Kayak and Paddle Boards which were both great. Overall a good stay, Marriott has to update their breakfasts, have stayed in many Marriott properties, the breakfast is always the same.Dear Thomas M,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel.

I was in town on business at the convention center, which is walking distance. This is a good place to stay, even for those visiting the Disney parks nearby. This is motel type place but renovated to modern standards with good fixtures. 2 Queen bedrooms are very spacious and clean. No breakfast here but it is close to many restaurants.	4.0

I had to request a room change because the initial room was not able to get wi-fi access (Room 405). We were allowed to move to Room 128 where it worked. The hotel was clean and up-to-date.

In fact, I can say of the five motels/hotels we stayed in on our trip -- in Pennsylvania and Virginia -- this one was the best.	5.0
Everyone there is very friendly, accommodating and helpful. Hidden behind Holiday Inn, it's very much worth the stay. This is the 3rd or 4th time we have used this hotel and will continue to. Never had a problem here and continental breakfast offers a huge variety.	5.0
My sister I were only in town for a day so we didn't need a lot of service when we were at the hotel. However, it did meet our requirements. The room was very clean, the woman at the front desk was polite professional when we checked in. We were very pleased with our short little stay. All we every ask is that the rooms are clean, the staff is respectful, it to be quiet. I will say that there were a lot of children. I don't know if this hotel is a vacation destination hotel because the amount of children was a little daunting. Granted, it is summer they do have a pool. The halls were still fairly quiet while we were on our way to check out, the room next to ours had a bunch of children in it we never had a problem with the noise level so I think it's safe to say the walls are pretty thick.	4.0
Spent 3 nights at the BW Pluss Inn at the Vines, located just outside of downtown Napa. Perfect location for what we needed. Recommend using Uber for transportation, so easy and fast. It appeared that there was plenty of parking available in the downtown area, but we preferred to walk and enjoy.TwinCityGrl - Thank you for taking the time to review our property. We are conveniently only 1 mile from Downtown Napa, so a quick cab ride away and you're in the heart of everything. We hope you come and see us again soon.	3.0

The hotel itself was good, good location,very close to downtown silver spring. there are public parking decks nearby (really don't need valet parking unless you are extra lazy). BUT the front desk was really sloppy. FIRST they didn't have our reservation in their system and wanted to charge us with the current rate which was 40 more expensive.

Our room was on the second floor accessed by stairs, but an easy climb. The hotel is not new, but has been redone very well and extremely clean. Although a train track is nearby, it was quiet enough to sleep through the night and there are many restaurants nearby, with a great variety of chains and local eateries. Very friendly... More	4.0

Was just a quick stay...late night in, morning out, but quite comfortable. Very nice accommodations, friendly staff, great breakfast area with room to spread out and get some work done. Aside from the extremely soft pillows, would definitely stay here again. Perfect location just 5 minutes from RDU airport and convenient to the entire metro area.	4.0
Checking in was the worst part of my experience. As I was standing in line to check in, there was one person in front of me who was being assisted and two other guests in line behind me also waiting to check in with only one front desk employee. I was in line for 7 minutes and never did the lady at the front desk make eye contact with me or signal her customer to hold on while she got some other employees to assist her. It was rude, unprofessional and totally unacceptable from any hotel of thus caliber. 2 minutes is the maximum amount of time you should wait before being acknowledged. Clearly the staff needs better training. That frustration aside, at approximately 6pm I ran into a friend from back home who was waiting for her room. She arrived at 4 and had been relegated to wait at the bar because there were no rooms available to honor her reservation. She had theater tickets and needed her room, so at her behest I inquired to the manager about its status. The manager was apologetic but couldn't guarantee when the room would become available. In the end it all worked out, but the my being neglected at check-in and her room not being ready are two things that you should never experience at a hotel like the St. Regis. Yes the rooms are nice, yes the hotel is well maintained, but the service is for me the most important, and the service that I experienced was slightly below average. Dear Billy R, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback following your stay with us at The St. Regis New York. We strive to provide world-class service to each and every guest during his or her time with us, and regret to discover that we have failed to meet the high standard we set for ourselves while you visited our landmark hotel.After reading your feedback, we will be sure to address the issues that arose during your stay as to offer the best experience possible to future guests, of which we hope you will be one.

Was greeted by a warm, welcoming staff upon arrival. The room was immediately available upon check in. The a/c was turned ON when the family entered the room. That was really nice! Considering it was very warm outside. All was clean in the room and bathroom. The stay was overall comfortable pleasant...at a great convenient and affordable rate per night. I have no complaints.	4.0
I liked the proximity to the ball park. It wasn't a bad walk at all even with a toddler. There is a parking garage for 10 a day diagonally across the street. Even walking back from the ball park at night wasn't bad. The hotel rooms are smaller than the norm but good for the price! There isn't complimentary breakfast or anything like that but there is a cafe one block over. They do have valet parking as well and seemed to be pretty quick. The employees were very friendly. Checking in and out was a breeze-the desk attendant was there to help with the self check in.	4.0
They have a nice breakfast buffet, with waffles, eggs, sausage, bagels, cold cereal, fruit. Shortly after I had checked out and left the premises, I realized I had left my Kindle behind. They were very helpful about letting me into the room to retrieve it.	4.0

This hotel is in a great location, right in the heart of everything. Parking is 35/day but right next door. The hotel staff was extremely friendly. The check in/check out procedure was very fast.

A friend of mine always books the cheapest, bare bones hotels when he travels. He says he'd rather spend money on doing things than on where he stays. I wholeheartedly disagree!!

We stayed for the weekend and made trips back and forth to the beach. It's about a 20 minute drive to the beach but we didn't run into any traffic. The continental breakfast was great! The hotel staff was great! Definitely would stay again!	4.0
1. I did not like the experience of dealing with the Expedia person who assisted with the reservation. 2. It was annoying to learn only while checking out that this is a time share hotel. No one told me. 3. The WIFI was slow, and unreliable, cutting out from time to time. Also, when it tried to upgrade to the offered higher speed WIFI, it was quite an ordeal that took about 90 minutes and a call to the help line at your WIFI vendor. BTW, you might try the user interface for that sign up - it exasperatingly erases all one's data entries if a single one of them is incorrect (eg if you generate an unacceptable password) 4. The Business Center has two PCs that are excruciatingly slow, and a printer as well that lumbers along. Old, slow, out of date. 5. The single bright light in this business experience is that the staff were unfailingly polite and did their best to help. I give them credit for trying, and for being nice to me.	2.0
I was driving from NY to NC and decided that I needed to rest. It was after 9pm . I pulled over to a rest stop and looked up Expedia for hotels near by. I got a hand full and picked one within my budget . What a relief to have that choice. my stay was pleasant , room was Clean, great staff. And free breakfast. Within 15minutes of booking , Ramada had my reservations. :).	5.0
part of the hotel look great and updated, but the room needed a major renovation. carpet was dirty and wrinkled (could trip on it), and the bathroom was dingy: white enamel broken off on bathtub, toilet paper holder coming off the wall, dirty shower curtain, etc. but the bed was relatively comfy and the hotel quiet when we stayed there. complimentary shuttle to metro station was very convenient. staff was not very friendly and we could not order anything at the bar because there wasn't anyone there (bartender at some point was eating nearby in the lobby but did not acknowledge us and at other times the bar was empty).	3.0
This Hampton Inn location was easily accessible and well kept. We enjoyed our nice comfortable rooms. The bathrooms were clean and the room as well as the hotel had a nice clean smell that reassured cleanliness. We would definitely consider staying at this property again.	5.0
Bad: Crazy static electricity in the rooms during winter. Good: Awesome place, and service.	5.0
Bad: Bed wasn't awful but could have been better. Parking is a couple blocks away in a garage (I would consider this neutral - pretty much standard for Miami Beach). Good: Quaint with an art deco feel. I will definitely be back!	5.0
We had a wonderful weekend at the Blue Sands Motel! Not only did they welcome our two standard poodles with open arms, but they were flexible with our late arrival and did everything possible to make our stay amazing.

I needed a place that was a quick on-and-off the highway to get to my conference. This one was convenient to 495 and 395. I appreciated the free breakfast, and there was a really big selection of good hot and cold food! I needed a break on the room rate because I only work part-time.	4.0
All of the usual accolades to a good hotel apply here. But I was particularly impressed by the employees' response when my 15-year-old granddaughter decided to socialize with some boys she met at the pool and didn't bother to tell me where she was going. The hotel's front desk and security people were extremely efficient and courteous in locating her, saving her 70-year-old grandfather much angst! And the service people in the restaurant area also went out of their way to get to know us.	5.0

A gorgeous hotel! Not a typical Hampton Inn. Easy to find and the location is convenient to vineyards, downtown Napa and you can walk to restaurants, shopping and movie theater. Inside the hotel is gorgeous and the guest rooms are all suites and huge! Mini fridge, huge shower, I could live in this room!	5.0
Great hotel with great proximity to Cambridge and Harvard. Restaurants, services and gym are fantastic. Pricey but generally worth it. Connected to large independent fitness club so no fears of arriving in the morning and finding all the equipment taken. Henrietta's Table restaurant is great for breakfast - either business breakfast or with family.	5.0
Bad: When we arrived we were met by a unfriendly doorman and it was so loud due to the bar that we could barely hear the person at reception. Each day the room was made up apparently but barely even folded the sheets. towels weren't folded etc. We have stayed in lots of hotels over the years and had recently stayed at the Loews Boston which was a far far better experience with far friendlier staff. Good: Food was awesome.	2.0
I stayed at this Motel 6, 311 Courtland St NE, Atlanta, GA, in August last year for a conference my job would not fund. I was totally on my own dime and so needed to economize. What a great deal this place was! The conference hotel was the Hilton literally next door, and those poor schmucks over there were paying over three times what I paid! For the same location! My room at the Motel 6 was clean, the bed was comfortable, the parking was FREE, AND I had a small balcony off my room on the 2nd floor! The staff was nice - what I saw of them. Granted, the staff at Motel 6 is small - there is no room service, no restaurant, and no bar at Motel 6. But they have all that at the Hilton next door and all over downtown Atlanta so Motel 6 doesn't need it!!! I will stay at this Motel 6 every time I have to go to Atlanta from now on. The location is perfect. I felt as safe as anywhere else I have stayed in Atlanta. What a sweet deal!	5.0

Well, they did it again. After a stay at this hotel back in August and the absolutely fabulous service from Erin Loughlin, I kept my promise of never staying anywhere else when I visit Chicago. And, because I love the great city of Chicago, I had to go back. This time, I had no question where my lodging would be as I trekked to and fro across the city streets. I LOVE the personal service. I have told so many people about my great experiences and I hope they choose to patronize this great hotel, too. Like Arnold Schwarzenegger said, I'll be back!	5.0

This hotel is clean and well kept. It looks to be newer than it actually is. It is convenient to stores and restaurants. The staff is friendly and courteous. The rooms are a good size. I found the pillows to be small and too soft for my liking. The only room available was for special needs, this was not expected. it lacked a bath tub. but the shower was ok. None of the soda machines worked correctly. It is not to close to the beach and there is no view of the harbor.	4.0

All in all, an OK experience. They have a little continental breakfast every morning, so that is nice. There is a Denny's across the street, so I did that a few mornings because I am a fan of a big breakfast variety. There is a gas station right next to the hotel that has a good selection of drinks and snacks, so that was a bonus because I didn't have to walk or drive far to get these items. A shout out to whoever makes the towel elephants. I couldn't bring myself to take it apart, it was so cool looking!	3.0

In New York it is uncommon to return to any large chain hotel and be greeted by the same person at the reception desk and even rarer for that person to actually remember you. Easy when they see your name you say but when they ask a personal question that indicates they really do remember you, it is special. My other posts on t.a. are redundantly complimentary about the St. Regis hotels. The lovely receptionist here in NYC, Je, is one of those special people. We try to visit NYC as often as possible being only 2 hours away in Connecticut and there is no finer place to stay than the St. Regis. I would highly recommend that if you enjoy traveling in style and want to be treated exceptionally well, get a Starwood American Express card and indulge yourself in its many generous gifts. Starwood is to be commended for attracting and keeping outstanding personel such as Je at the NYC St. Regis .Dear WHVIP,On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at our hotel. We are thrilled to hear how much you enjoy staying here, and we deeply appreciate your loyalty. We will share your kind words with Jie, and look forward to seeing you again soon.Warmest Regards, Daniela CataldoDirector of Rooms	5.0

The Troubadour was an awesome hotel for us! I absolutely LOVED the decor. The bed side tables couldnt be beat! The roof top bar was an incredible view and it was even more special because thats where my boyfriend proposed! I couldnt ask for a better view. Its a nice central location and the food market next door was awesome! The only thing I wish was better was the valet service. They werent very timely and one of them gave us serious attitude. Other than that it was incredible and I would 100 go back!! Thank you so much for taking the time to share this lovely review of your stay with us at The Troubadour.

The best western plus is located 10 minutes away from downtown Napa. It is located on Soscal Avenue that connects you to many of the top Yelp eateries. The hotel itself is what we have come to expect from the Best Western Brand. Clean and comfortable rooms, but nothing extravagant. There is a short swimming pool (8 yards) and a hot tub with jets. The property was quiet and had ample parking. There is a Denny's around the corner and that didnt bother me like other reviewers. The only trace is that you can smell sausage and pancakes from the parking lot. They do offer a free full breakfast with coffee. Overall I would recommend this hotel if you are afraid of the bed and breakfast scene like I am. Thank you for your review and recommendation. Our rewards members receive a free breakfast in the attached Denny's and most of our reviewers rate it above average as a Best Western Breakfast.. We are glad you enjoyed your free breakfast and stay with us and we hope to see you again in the near future.	4.0

We booked this hotel for one night following a wedding shower in the Kansas City area.

We were lucky to find a vacancy at this hotel in Paola, which turned out to be a wonderful place to sleep... More	5.0
The staff (front desk, restaurant and maintenance) are all friendly, warm and very helpful. The restaurant is average for dinner, but serves the best breakfast I've had in a hotel (ordered from the menu). The pancakes still haunt my dreams! The room had a number of maintenance issues, which were promptly addressed by the hotel as much as possible. I... More	3.0
Stayed two nights in late April. The parking is a little confusing as it is shared with the hotel next door and could use more lighting. The attendance was very pleasant when checking in. The manager was very helpful in the morning pulling additional chairs for the folks to be able to sit in the crowded breakfast area. Clean place.... More	3.0
Excellent service at the Best Western Prarie Inn, Albany, ORegon. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel.

Amazing place to stay with kids, friendly staff, good breakfast variety. Exercise room was clean and well equipped. Indoor pool very small but correct temperature and Relaxing hot jacuzzi tub. I would recommend this hotel.	4.0

We booked Nopsi for my 40th birthday and this hotel lived up to my expectations. My spouse is a lifetime Marriott Platinum member so we have had our fair share of hotel stays. The service and hospitality was amazing. The staff was courteous without feeling stuffy...the best way to describe them was authentic with a large does of Southern hospitality and they were all wonderful.They upgraded us to a better room which comprised of a wrap around view. The upgrade was complimentary even though they were fully booked. Two thumbs up and what a wonderful way to kick-off my birthday.The hotel bed is amazing. I described it as feeling hugged but not hot. I received the best sleep and my spouse said the same. I'm a side sleeper and he's a back sleeper so it's shocking that we both like the mattress.The bed was so comfortable that I emailed the hotel to get the make of the mattress and will order it for our own home.We frequented the lobby bar and the drinks were on point.I don't recall the name of my drink but it reminded me of salty plum but our bartender described it as vinegary. Personally, I thought it was well-balanced. The Frenchman was also well-made here. The rooftop bar was a scene but not compared to Orange County or LA. Much less pretentious and the skyline was pleasant.As others have mentioned, the hotel is not in the middle of the action but walking distance to Bourbon St and many of the best local restaurants (GW Fins being my fav for the grilled oysters and desserts).Bottom line, I would stay here again the next time we are in NOLA.Sara, thank you so much for choosing to stay at NOPSI! Its wonderful to learn that you had such a fun and memorable 40th birthday with us. We love making all occasions special, and were delighted to have won you over. A terrace room overlooking the city certainly provides an unforgettable experience. We hope you and your husband will make visiting us an annual birthday tradition so that we may treat you to more pleasant surprises!Warm Regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager	5.0
We stayed here the night before our cruise departed. The rooms are far from the office, pool and breakfast room. Rooms are a bit small but clean. Breakfast was good but crowded. The front office seemed to be understaffed for the volume of visitors.	3.0
This was a reasonably priced place in a great location right on the lake. Good restaurants were easily accessible and the hot tub and pool were nice.

the place was great but has the wifi in the room doen't work when you try to enter the password on the screen or there is none shown but however, the network where it was available. if there is no connected to the password ,knowing it will not work.....the hotel must upgraded the router..instead of sending the guest to the starbuck.	4.0
We stayed for 4 days while we were in town for a friend's wedding. The hotel was surprisingly quiet inside and out. It had a great location right of the main road.

Bad: Our toilet overflowed at 1am and the water wouldn't stop. When we tried to call reception the phone didn't work. My husband went down to reception whilst I packed our clothes as I naturally assumed we would be given another room. He returned with a maintenance employee and a housekeeping employee. They refused to give us another room (so we could go back to sleep!) instead keeping us awake until 2am whilst they sorted out the problem, extracted the water from the floor (the bathroom was flooded), mopped the floor and brought fresh towels. Good: The reception staff were very friendly. A bottle of sparkling was sent to our room to celebrate our wedding anniversary upon our arrival. That was a really nice touch.	3.0
This hotel was in a terrific location.  Walking distance from all sights.  The hotel staff was very accommodating. We arrived very early in the morning and they had a room for us.  Our flight out was late in the day, so they held our luggage and also called for our cab service to the airport, which arrived right on schedule.	5.0
The hotel staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. The beds were comfortable and sheets were clean. Check-in was a breeze.	5.0
I had a wonderful experience during my hotel stay. It was very clean and the staff was excellent. Anytime I needed help, they offered they're assistance. They exercise room was clean and they offered free coffee and hot chocolate all day and night. They had a very nice breakfast too.	5.0

Lets see...where to begin. Perhaps it was the dust storm created on a windy day by the unpaved lot next door that created a scene from the Grapes of Wrath as the Joads outran a duststorm that literally almost obliterated the hotel.

We had a great time. When I booked the Hotel I booked it for the inside pool for Spring Break for my grandchildren. I didn't even realize all the other perks of this hotel for kids. Inside pool, inside playground, inside game room and mini golf. I would totally stay here again for kids it was great.	5.0

This is the 2nd time we stayed at this motel, we travel for Craft Shows. Like the fact that you park off to the side and are on a service road. Ease of in and out makes it easy for us. Only problem is no breakfast available until 7 and we need to be gone by 6 am to set... More	4.0
Fabulous fun at a great hotel in the middle of the French Quarter! Friendly, helpful staff, lovely clean, comfortable room.

Service is great, Charles is awesome, he goes above and beyond to take care of us. Everyone, actually, was very friendly and very helpful. The only two things we didn't like was the room had a horrible view, and the pillows were so soft that they didn't provide any support, and that made sleep not very comfortable.	4.0
Very nice hotel - mainly aimed at honeymooners. Our room was upgraded to a suite as we were on out HMoon - lovely services. Only downfall, can't go all-in as it's the USA! Food was rather pricey on site, nothing close by so best to hire a car. Overall, amazing HMoon!	4.0
We recently stayed at the Silver Cloud Inn to go to the Maroon 5 concert and were very pleasantly surprised. Staff was very friendly and helpful.

We had a couple of days to spend in Chicago and wanted a hotel close to our car rental and to a train station, this place fit the bill. It's right in the middle of downtown Chicago and within walking distance to pretty much everything. It wasn't too cheap compared to normal hotels but all the other hotels close by were a lot more expensive so it felt like a good deal.It's a very simple lobby with just a couple of people in the reception and you could check in via a touch screen. There was a restaurant right next by but we didn't try it. There's plenty of restaurants and shops everywhere close by anyway.We ordered a room with two beds because of our kid and was expecting two beds close together, but we got a huge room which was pretty much two rooms in one with a hallway in between. It had two TVs and two bathrooms. I don't know if we just got lucky and got the biggest room they had for that price or if they're all like that. It was a great surprise for us and our kid could even play hide and seek with us!	5.0
Alright. I'm going to keep it extremely real with you guys. This is hotel is just okay but the price, location, and amenities make it good. LOCATION It's in the hood. No joke.

The exterior and lobby were very unappealing. Very blah. The room was better--updated and clean. However at least 3 times water pipes clanged and thunked. One time was during the night and it woke of us. Not happy about that. The area around the hotel was only fair looking.	3.0
Bad: The Wi-Fi works with a portal login, I had to log-in like 5 times each day for every device I was using, even if I hadn't left the room. Super annoying and I'd say enough reason for any business traveller to avoid an otherwise super nice hotel. Good: The hotel is super stylish, the room was perfect. The hotel feels new clean throughout. Nice atmosphere in the bar area.	4.0
Good location, easy access to restaurants and hospitals.	5.0
Overall very good stay..staff was very friendly. We at first were given a room without a fridge and microwave which we had booked. The front desk employee quickly changed our room and apologized immediately. Breakfast is from 630-10 and it's a great spread. The chef comes out to ask how everyone is doing and ensures the sterno and food supplies are fully stocked. Hot food, cereals, muffins,bagels,yogurt,fruit,pancake maker,burrito bar you name it they had it. Didn't feel rushed at all. We were 15 away from the city area and it's close to the highway which was convienient. Room was good but walls need to be insulated you can hear everything in the next room. Housekeeping was good. Pool wasn't open but that wasn't a major issue for us. Plenty of parking. Overall good stay we would come back.	5.0
Our room was charming with a comfortable bed and a small but perfectly adequate ensuite also, good wifi signal. The owner/host was welcoming/friendly and helpful without being intrusive and the breakfast provided the next morning was superb. Hiking trails are nearby or take a stroll around town. Would definitely stay here again. Tip: Before booking room, find out if it... More	5.0
I first read the reviews of this hotel on this site and mostly all said great things about this hotel and i can see why. When you first get here it does't look or seem like your ordinary hotel from the outside. However, The Hotel hostess were extremely nice, The room was awesome, the bed slept great, room was comfort and cosey, if i decided to cook in the kitchen i could have. Great area, and you can walk to Iwo Jima memorial, or walk to Rosslyn area to eat. I will return with fam friends in spring time.....	5.0
I recently spent two nights at the Hyatt House on Fifth Avenue in Seattle. Great Location - but I felt the Hyatt House was a bit disappointing. It began with the check-in early Sunday evening. Two Hyatt Housers were on the desk - but only one working intake. I waited about 5 minutes to be checked in. Next was the size of the room - extremely small even for the room type. Next was the food service in the bar - absolutely the worst burnt cheeseburger I have had in quite a while accompanied by 16 broken potato chip pieces and a cupcake which was advertised to be scrumptiously fancy (it was not - it was plain awful and dry). Next was the shower - no water pressure (and this is a relatively new hotel). One of the better highlights was breakfast, while selection was limited - the food was good.Hyatt Houses are usually outstanding - evidently I caught the Seattle Hyatt House on Fifth Avenue during a underperforming period.ZAismy2ndHome,Feedback from our guests is very important to us and we appreciate the detailed concerns. We strive to exceed all of our guests expectations and know we still have some work to do. Please let us know if there is anything we further assist with - we look forward to another opportunity to serve you in the future.Sarah Junge	3.0

We spent the weekend here last week for a college visit and apart from having a floor full of teenagers visiting the hotel, we had a very good experience staying here.

I was hesitant staying here but I am extremely happy I did, our room was a very spacey corner double and it had a wonderful view. Customer service was incredible, Kathy was able to check us in a little earlier and I forgot his name but made a mean bacon and egg croissant sandwich. Hotel is in a great location 2 blocks away from Bourbon and one from Canal. Close to everything but far enough to hear all the noise. I would definitely stay there again especially for the great rate we got.Thanks so much for your review! I always enjoy sharing comments like these with our staff and giving Kathy and our cook, Mike the kudos they deserve. We are delighted you had a great time here with us and we look forward to having you back with us again soon.Cheers,Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager	5.0

My husband and I enjoyed our stay here. The staff is very friendly and the rooms are very nice. They have a kitchen that helps to save on eating out.

Overall our stay was ok, Staff was not helpful when checking in. One attendant said she will help you in a minute after she gets off phone. Then after she was off and I stood there for few minutes she said can i help you. I said we are checking in, She said that the other attendant will help me!! Finally checked in, Room was ok, Nothing spectacular although the mirror was so clean my wife thought there was another room. lol Biggest downfall was that there seemed to be a lot of coming and going late at night/early morning. Hotel is right behind a questionable restaraunt. We did not have any issues though, just a feeling of concern,	3.0
Our room smelled like cigarette and it was dingy! Thankfully the manager was willing to give us a new room and upgraded to a suite. I think ALL the carpet needs to be replaced in all the rooms. This place should be categorized as a motel, not a hotel. Staff was nice though.	2.0
Rented out all cabins and grounds for a recent event. Not a complaint to be heard from any of our guests and some can be difficult to please.

Great place to stay with the kids! It has a nice pool, an indoor play area, and an arcade. The breakfast is what you would expect from other hotels not overly fancy.

My hotel stay at the Hilton Garden Inn can only be described as over the top excellent. I was warmly welcomed by a wonderful front desk clerk named Jennifer who demonstrated exemplary customer service. The hotel was absolutely gorgeous and smelled wonderful - seriously. I stayed in a Jr. Suite and found the room to be comfortable, super clean, and well appointed. My only complaint, and it is relatively small, is that the breakfast buffet wasn't that great especially given the price. When I mentioned this upon check-out I was promptly given a Barnes Noble gift card in an effort to make up for my less than satisfactory restaurant experience. Was I impressed You bet!!!! I have never received such wonderful customer service during any hotel stay as I did at the Hilton Garden Inn. I will ALWAYS make it a point to stay at this hotel each time I visit family in the area.	5.0

Save your money- this was the worst hotel in which I have EVER stayed!!! We should have just turned around and left when we pulled into the hotel parking lot and saw a police cruiser sitting out front. The hotel stay went downhill from there. The side lot of the hotel is poorly lit and we did not feel safe parking there. There were ants in the shower, the linens were ripped, and the window had a 1/2 inch of dirt on the sill. Supplies to make a cup of coffee were in the room, but there was no coffee maker. We called the front desk to arrange for shuttle to the casino and were told it would be a 20 minute wait. After 30 minutes, we walked out to the front desk to find out how much longer it would be. The staff informed us that they had forgotten to put us on the list for the shuttle... we would have been waiting forever!! I plugged my cellphone in to charge overnight, and awoke to find that it had not charged at all... the outlet had no power supply.	1.0

We stayed the weekend at the River Hotel and could not have been happier. The staff at the front desk was amazing. They provided us with coupons for a free appetizer or dessert at Lou Malnatis. They also provided some great recommendations for breakfast. The room was great. It was a little small but all Chicago rooms are small. It was clean and had a great view of the river and the Trump building across the river. The bed was comfortable. The location was close to all the downtown attractions with a big bus double decker bu stop right across the street.	5.0
The property is in a quiet area with a sister property across the parking lot. It's a nice building with an attentive staff. They were very friendly.

Air conditioning unit whined like an airliner approaching a landing-annoying plus wasn't very efficient! Mattress's have seen better day's ( or in this case - better night's ) need replacing. Our room was on the Interstate side (back of hotel) VERY NOISEY- actually thought at one point that the window was open. Ironing board leg's were severely bent - broke in half when attempting to close after use - which was difficult to use since it wouldn't lock upright!	2.0

This is a very clean hotel with spacious rooms in a beautiful scenic locale. They offer a full hot breakfast and have coffee available 24/7 and the rates are very reasonable.

We made reservations on November 9, 2011 for a stay on the night of May 16, 2012 and specifically asked for a non-smoking room. When we arrived at 11 p.m., the desk clerk casually told us the only room left was a smoking room. No explanation as to what had happen to our reservation for a non-smoking room. No apology. She couldn't have cared less. The smell that greeted us when we opened the door to the room was unbelievable. I slept with a clean towel on my pillow to avoid the tobacco smell that permeated every inch of the room. Not going back there anytime soon.	2.0

The other review was obviously written by one of the owners. Grossest room I have ever been in. Only good thing I can say is they were nice enough to refund my mY money so I could go somewhere else.

After stopping over for one night in another city on the way to Springfield and being very disappointed in that hotel (Super 8), I was tempted to cancel my reservations here, but when we checked in, we were all pleasantly surprised and very satisfied with the rooms - very clean, helpful and polite staff, good hot/cold breakfast, etc. I had reserved two rooms (myself husband and in-laws). We checked in Tues and out on Sat - no problems at all. We would definitely stay at this hotel again.	5.0

The staff were extremely friendly. Randall was very informative and helpful. The location is great, across the street from the Santa Monica pier. The room was quiet.

Excellent hotel to stay in when visiting Chattanooga. Helpful and friendly staff. Reasonably priced. Clean rooms.

This is a good place to go if you're just there for a night and you've spent all your money on Hamilton tickets. It's very close to the theater and was the price was nice compared to other hotels nearby.

The rooms were great. There is a great kitchen with the needed amenities. The bed was comfortable and the room was a good size. The breakfast was good but having one person was not enough.

Pluses: reasonable rates, great helpful friendly staff, shuttle to trains, nearby mall, lots of dining choices minutes from hotel. Minuses : mattresses old and needing update, rooms dark more lights will help lots, a refrigerator is a must in a room. Long ride into town by train and 5-6 bucks each way. Tip: leave your car at the station for 5 bucks and fast return to hotel or mall.	4.0
I arrived on a cold, frosty night after a long flight and drive. Front desk staff was courteous and made checkout a quick process.

Needed hotel near office location in Tampa and Hilton is always my first choice.This Hilton Garden Inn was a hidden gem. Warm welcome with cookies, coffee, and water in the lobby. Room was average but I felt safe and slept really well which is unusual for me at a hotel! Will definitely stay here again and recommend it.	4.0
The hotel was clean, and in good repair for the most part. The internet was sketchy, and did not work for the first night. The availability of wireless being the reason I choose this hotel, this was quite bothersome. It is kind of a ride to DC, though not terrible. The shuttle service picking us up from the train was late despite numerous calls. Some of the customer service was better than others, just depends who you talk to. The surrounding area leaves something to be desired. In the end, it was not terrible, but it was not great either.	2.0
Good: Love the location on the Chicago River. I liked the hotel before the Remodel. Dispointed no Christmas tree in the lobby. Bedding as always super comfy (I like Westin hotels). . I've stayed here many times and if the price is right will continue, however if your looking to walk into a hotel and get wow factor, this one is not for you.	4.0
Very friendly, great location in the French Quarter very comfortable. It was just down the sidewalk from Bourbon street but far enough to get away from the late night partying. I give it a 5 star rating.	5.0
Beautiful hotel, very convenient to the metro in Crystal City. Wonderful complimentary breakfast. Enjoyed manager's reception nightly. Will stay here again - this was our second visit in 5 years to the same hotel. Spacious suites. Nice large flat panel televisions - 2 per suite. Workout room adequate. We had a dead battery in the hotel garage and the guest services attendant helped us find a car service employee who assisted us for no charge! Only suggestion - bathrooms need exhaust fans! I believe they are scheduled to be remodeled soon...	5.0

Nice hotel, with good rooms and beds. Location is not really close to Riverwalk and it would take you a good 15 min walk to reach there. Alamo is relatively closer. There is nothing much right next to the hotel. Breakfast, checkin, checkout and the reception staff were all good. Breakfast staff could have been a bit more courteous.	4.0
Friendly hotel staff (99) and a lot of food options with 5 mins or so. But the entire hotel smells musty and needs updating. Beds are HORRIBLE, 3rd shift front desk unpleasant/lazy, and with VA traffic you're more like 45 mins from the beach.	3.0

I was quite disappointed with this hotel.

We had stayed at the Culver Cove years ago and were hoping things hadn't changed. We were disappointed to find the look of the inn has deteriorated. The condo we stayed in was dirty.

The Suncoast Hotel itself was nice. The room we had was a standard king room and very spacious and clean. The bed and pillows were rather industrial (hard). The fitness room was well-maintained and the hotel overall pleasing. The casino was well-ventilated and equipped with all the standard gaming.The breakfast buffet was a bargain for we mature folks. The evening buffet was mediocre at best.The desk was verrrry slow in checking in.The biggest disadvantage of the Suncoast is its location out away from the Strip and downtown. It is isolated in a more residential part of northwest Las Vegas. They do try to compensate by making a free shuttle available which ran on time and took guests to the airport or to the Strip.	3.0
Bad: I stayed at this hotel for 2 days..they asked me to pay 100 deposit even though I did not know that I had to spit this money before booking the room I finally agreed and in good faith and i paid I was told that the money will be returned back to my account within 7 working daysand so it was done for 1 month and the money I did not get back.	1.0

We received two free weekend nights from Suncoast. Our room was spacious and clean. The beds were comfortable. Whenever we saw an employee they greeted us and were willing to assist! We had to book an extra night and it was very reasonable. I experienced Pure Spa which is on site. WOW! They offered a great combo spa treatment which was to die for! The buffet resturant was also better then expected. Usually buffets are pretty boring but theirs was actually pretty good!	4.0

Attention to detail was incredible at one of New York City's finest hotels.Our suite was beautiful, and despite being worried about traffic noise, we were surprised to have had a very restful night. We used travel points to book our room, and were very impressed to have been upgraded to a better room - this is excellent service and excellent recognition that people who travel all the time rarely cash in their points, but when they do ... it leaves a lasting impression and a very much increased likelihood that we will return and also highly recommend.Well done!Dear SuenearBoston, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

Bad: The wait to enter the buffet was too long never got in the whole week.. When I went to the other restaraunt I was told I couldn't order certain items as they are for happy hour only so I left. They also did not have a pool or any alternative except travel 18 miles to their other facility and use their pool. They never even gave me a discount for lack of this facitilityor even notifying me as I made my reservation months in advance, I also did not like having to park outside of the parking garage only cause I was riding a motorcycle the parking garage was for cars only. I felt as though I was a second class citizen, no laundry facility service or machines . Good: The location was good and the staff especially the cleaning of my room was great.	3.0

This is a very nice property for tourists, but business travelers should look elsewhere. The internet service is very poor. So, if you have to work in your room at night and require internet access, this will not be a good choice for you. Also, I have never been to a hotel that does not get NBC on the TV - one of the major networks. I was going to inform the management of my concerns, but when I checked out, no one asked me how was your stay, so I didn't bother.	3.0

The hotel is right across the river from the Trump Hotel. It's a 50 cab ride from the airport. Watched a Cubs game while there. Wrigley field wasn't too far away by taxi.

This hotel did not meet my expectations. The room was sparsely furnished and not clean. There was a bunch of hair behind the bathroom door where staff had not cleaned the bathroom properly. The bed squeaked with every move and it was the only piece of furniture to sit on. The ceiling above us squeaked as well. No desk, no chair, no in-room coffee service, and no place to sit and relax outside. The entry door keypad was completely busted and the parking lot was deteriorating badly.

Visited D.C. for two days and found this to be gret for what we needed. Close to the metro and shuttle service to and from. Breakfast was ok...not that much variety but for the price adequate. Only issue we had was with the shuttle one evening we got in about two minutes after the scheduled shuttle from metro to hotel and they would not wait for us. I think a small exception could have been made to wait a minute or two at 10 pm to wait for a guest that was on the phone with you telling you that they were one stop away. Front desk just said sorry we cant wait..next shuttle will be in 30 minutes. We took a taxi and although its probably only a quarter of a mile drive it cost ten dollars. I have mixed feelings about how that situation was handled being in customer service but I can also understand that there has to be structure as well. Overall a good place to stay.. I would recommend it to friends.	4.0
On a recent road trip, we stayed at several hotels - mostly Best Westerns. This one was by far the best of them all. The staff was very friendly, the room was clean and fresh and the breakfast area had the most variety. They had lots of fruit, which was hard to come by in the other hotels. Everything was...

Its far from DC. but hotel is good. Sorrounding also is good, lots of eating places nearby. Room was big and worth its price. But AC was not too cool. Hotel should provide a fridge in the room. My kid picked up a wafer which she put it back. But I find they charged me for that from my credit card statement. They did not even confirm from me. I had to lodge a complaint and they reverted back the amount.	4.0
We were pleased with our stay, for the most part. The carpeting in the hallway seemed kinda dirty, but our room was clean. I didn't like that breakfast was only until 9 am. And the breakfast hostess, who was very nice, started taking it all down at 8:50. She did tell someone if they wanted yogurt, she would go in the back and get it. But I felt like I had to rush through breakfast.	3.0

The room was very clean and you can't beat the location. The Riviera bar and pool on the roof is a nice amenity to have so you can relax for a few hours before the night life. You are walking minutes from whatever you want to do in the French Quarter.	5.0

This is a beautiful hotel! The staff was excellent and we had an awesome stay. I recommend renting the bikes and riding over the bridge to downtown Long Beach.

I was traveling for work during the spring training season. The price was right at this hotel. The room was comfortable but the surrounding area was not very nice.	4.0
I've heard such great things about the Chelsea, but their Annex is a dump. It really is. My bathroom was filthy. Neither my bathroom light nor my entryway light worked- we just had to use lamps. The room smelled like smoke or a gross cleaning agent, I couldn't tell. The walls are paper thin- I could hear a casual conversation in the room adjacent to ours. Even the elevator had 3 holes in its walls! Great location to Tropicana, but we won't stay there again.	1.0
We had booked at this hotel 4 months in advance because TripAdvisor said this was the 1 hotel in Winnfield and honestly we did not even stay for 1 hour, we went to our room called La Jagu and moved to that hotel, please see my review of that hotel for information about it.

Totally disgusting!! Room smelled of mold. Flushed the toilet and water leaked all over the floor. Went to the desk and the jerks handed me a towel and a bucket to catch the leaks!! Then they charged us twice but my bank cancelled the second charge. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT GOING THERE!	1.0
I traveled 38 hours (2,592.3 miles) to this hotel. True indeed it is a nice hotel but management (Danielle or Daniella) is so unprofessional, inconsiderate, insensible, heartless, undiplomatic, shameless person.

Overall the hotel, area and staff are nice. But my first stay at this hotel was in December only to find that we had tiny ants all over our room, including our suitcase the next morning...YUCK! The hotel was very apologetic and offered me a free stay next time we were in the area. I took them up on the offer and would have thought the room they put me in would have been checked first, but yep you guessed it...ants again (in February and on a completely different floor)! I think it's time they called an exterminator! They moved me to a different room, but offered nothing else. Won't go back.	3.0
I've never been to a hotel where I had to pay to park in the facilty. 36 a night was ridiculous, the food tasted like it was for a school breakfast, the hotel for being in the downtown area looked worst than any hood I ever was in. They removed more money than they were supposed to thinking I wasn't going to notice, I was supposed to get a discount rate and they tried not to apply it. The pool and the fitness room was cool. the hotel was clean.	2.0

Enjoyed my stay at the Suncoast, I was in for a wedding with my daughter and there were plenty of things to do for the kids. I enjoyed the movie theater and bowling alley which kept us occupied in between family events. The rooms are very good as well. Ventilation was not the best in the casino on the first day and you could smell more smoke than normal.	4.0
The Hyatt Valencia, located near Magic Mountain in non-descript Santa Clarita is a dressed up basic hotel.

Room not as promised on Hotels.com! Supposed to be a view of river instead we got View of Parking lot and back of Hotel...kept it as a running joke for rest of trip. Called the desk and they said they just didn't have any other rooms. Otherwise Hotel is well maintained. Cost 15 for self parking..not bad for a city downtown I suppose. Certainly a good bed, clean rooms, efficient elevators etc.,quiet, friendly staff	3.0
The stay was adequate but the hotel was dark inside. First thing that hit us when entering the room was a strong odor of some sort of freshener. When going over the essentials, it did not have any toothpaste. Although the staff is very nice, we requested toothpaste 4 times within 3 hours before it was finally delivered. Still, the stay was adequate for the price we paid in this area.	3.0
Staff were very helpful and the motel is very nice. Modern, quality gym, good breakfast and the staff work hard to please customers. I will stay here again this was a pleasant experience.

Bad: One lonely and confused roach in the bathroom. Breakfast, but since we're Europeans this may be a matter of taste. Good: Spacious, comfortable rooms with air conditioning and dehumidifiers too. Nice reception area with a 24hrs possibility to buy toiletries, snacks, etc. Very close to the Disney parks and just next to a great Asian restaurant.	4.0
Overall, our stay was enjoyable. Right away, we did notice the remote didn't work, so I asked the front desk for some new batteries. They provided them, but the remote still wouldn't turn the TV on. Finally, after tapping the remote on the table, it started working. The room condition was good, and the beds were comfortable. Something that seemed unsanitary, however, was at breakfast, we found a hair on a spoon for the eggs. We showed one of the people behind the counter, but all she did was take the hair off the spoon. That was an uncomfortable situation.	4.0

Worst hotel experience I have ever had. While waiting to check in, I overheard the 2 gentleman in front of me, basically planning their party in the room they were getting and the reception told them where the liquor store was. The reception clerk was nice, and checked us in quickly. That was the best thing about this experience. My wife and I walked into the room and we're immediately hit with a terrible smell, and before we could complain the phone rang in the room, which was the reception desk calling to tell us that she should not have put us in that room because of the smell, and to come to the desk for new keys to a different room, which we obliged. We got our new keys and went to the new room, which smelled better, but looked sketchy, so we pulled back the covers on the bed to see ants crawling around. This was the moment we decided to check out and went right across the street to the Hampton Inn, which was great and highly recommended. We never stayed at this hotel and never will. All I needed was a clean bed to stay in for a few hours so I could catch a flight, but this hotel couldn't even provide that. In fact this hotel just seemed like a party spot for locals and would not feel comfortable even parking my car in the parking lot. It's really a shame that this hotel is like this. It's in a great location and could be nice. Shame on me, as I did not heed the warning signs from the other reviews. Thought it would be okay for a few hours sleep. I was wrong	1.0

Great location oceanfront on Boardwalk. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Room just need some updating and wasn't exactly clean.

BW has an annex! It's on the far side of the street. We had a roach and a broken air conditioner the first day. Had to repack and move to another room! On the third day in 103 degrees the elevator broke. We're 75 and our new room was on the third floor! All outside surfaces are covered w tar rather than repaving. It's pealing and looks very shabby. Only four umbrellas at the outdoor pool for over 100 guests! We had stayed in the main bldg. before, and were very disappointed to be across the street.	2.0

Overall the hotel is ok, except we had to ride for about 30-45 mins to find a decent resturant because the one that was located at the hotel was closed due to a family reunion. Because of the convienence of the resturant was part of the reason why i stayed and once we got there and they said that someone had reserved it we were very disappointed.	5.0

I just got back from my 4 night stay here at the SunCoast hotel. I have to say that rooms are spacious, nice and very clean. Valet staff was also nice and was understanding when I forgot a couple items and the gentlemen who helped us carry our bags was very kind and welcoming as well. On the other hand, costumer service is very bad.Front desk staff is horrible. At some point, there was three families in line and all three of the front desk agents were looking at their computer screens completely ignoring that they had guests waiting to check in and check out for about 5 minutes (didn't even look up once). One afternoon I tried to order room service at around 2:40 and to my surprise the lady on the phone advised me that there wasn't anyone to take my order at the moment. So If i wanted to eat I had to go downstairs to the restaurant. At the restaurant, the staff was welcoming. They seated us quickly. But their attention to detail was missing. I had asked for a drink with ice and they would forget the ice. I order a plate a fruit which they completely forgot and tried to charge me for it. Thankfully I remember and got the charge voided. At the check out, a lady with white hair helped me and when I asked her for a bill she replied in a rude tone, Yeah! That's what I'm doing. Might not sound like a bad response but it's the way the person says it that has a bad effect. When I first arrived I immediately thought this was a beautiful hotel. Which it is, but I do believe the staff needs to have some costumer service orientations. (Or perhaps consider hiring younger more friendly people).

Our utility company needed to make upgrades to the sytem in our neighborhood and therefore, had to cut power for the day. We decided on a staycation, as the hotel was only 15 miles from our home. I'm glad we made the decision. The accomodations were large, comfortable and clean. We appreciated the manager's reception and our daughter loved the pool.

There was a restaurant charge on my invoice for 139.00 and I contacted the front desk to notify them that I did not eat at their restaurant, charge a meal to my room or order room service so obviously someone used by credit card info on file to charge a meal. The person working the front desk was dismissive and rude and just said We'll look it to it. I told him that was not good enough I wanted to know if my charge info and identity was compromised so I could notify my bank. I'll cut to chase he was no help. I asked to speak to a manage but I was told there was not manager on duty so two hours later I finally spoke to a manager Jim who told me the charges would be reversed in 3 days...I still don't know if my personal info has been compromised and I have to monitor my account everyday and the charges have still not been reversed.

The young, hip hotel guests probaby cringed when they saw me schlep my 4, 6, and 8 year olds through the front door and I immediately realized our family was not the hotel's target demographic, but we LOVED this place. As a former New Orleans resident, this is as local as you can get. Compar Lapin was unbelievable and my children could not get enough of their homemade pasta and gnocchi and probably would have gone home with our server, Clare (that is how much they liked her). The head cocktail crafter, Abby, was super friendly and insanely adorable and her staff was extremely talented and helpful. The room was so comfortable my children slept almost two hours past their norm, which was probably appreciated by the majority of guests who had been tearing up their livers the night before. We did not use maid service so my only suggestion would be a little more counter space in the bath and more towels. Other than that, it was perfect.	5.0
We were regulars the Shawnee Motel until our last visit on 8/9/15 when Thelma Triplett called and said she was appalled that we had the room air-conditioner on 60 and I said we were hot and she responded she was hot too and for us leaving it on at 60 degrees, she was canceling our reservations for Bedford Days...

we usually stay in Hilton Products. I had read an article about Drury and was intrigued so we decided to expand our horizons WOW, am I glad we did!

Bad: Too expensive, thought when I booked that happy hour and breakfast were included. The room was not worth 300.00 a night. Good: Loved the location and view	4.0
Bad: Everything was so good!! None!. Good: Everything! Oh my! What a view! Staff was wonderful, Bed pillow soft!! Food delicious! Access to so much! Perfect stay!! Next time I plan on coming with my husband so he can experience this wonderful place! He is a big Cub fan! He will love the Westin Inn North Chicago too!	5.0
Shoney's is right next door and the Carroll's General Store is just a quick drive behind the motel. This made all the difference in the world.	4.0
The good Near restaurants and shops, wifi and price. The bad. Reserved non smoking room with king bed, put us in room with 2 doubles. They corrected this. Kitchenette consisted of small microwave and fridge. No lamps, alarm clock or radio in room. Room wasn't particularly clean ( straws and small trash in corners, crumbs by night stand) Grounds not...

Bad: The coffee for the in room coffee maker was awful....couldn't drink it. Sooooo bitter and strong !. Good: The bed was extra comfy. View from the room great (overlooked the High Roller) and the room was very clean and housekeeping great.	5.0
First rate staff and facility. We were ending a long and somewhat stressful trip, and this was a welcome place to unwind and recover. The staff truly could not do enough to make us comfortable. What a pleasure to be in a place where they use metal keys! No lockouts with a magnetic key after 2 or 3 days, as happens in other places. Coffee in the lobby, a newspaper at our door in the morning, and a wonderful whirlpool and sauna to unwind. Also, a fine fitness room.	5.0
This is our second family reunion there and both times were wonderful. It was peaceful and beautiful. The courtyard had barbecue pits and the condos were well stocked. We sat on the patio most of the time and just visited. A marvelous place to stay when in a group. A little pricey but still a good time. Just off the... More	4.0
This is a budget hotel which has been recently remodeled. No frills, small but clean and neat. We had a king size bed which had the most comfortable mattress of our entire trip! The sheets were crisp and clean, so relaxing after a long day of activities. The area was quiet and we had no safety issues. There is coffee in the lobby which was good. No other food or drink except vending machines, but numerous eating choices on the same street. There is no elevator, but we had a ground floor room, so this wasn't an issue for us. Overall a good value if you are just looking for a place to sleep. We would definitely stay there again.	3.0
Pros: Amazing location right in front of the beach, and a short driving distance away from South Beach. Beautiful lobby, free wifi, great breakfast, staff was really nice but could've been more proactive. Make sure to book an oceanfront room and ask for a high floor - it's TOTALLY worth it. Cons: Check-in was awful. I booked a room with... More	4.0
Perfect for our needs. Convenient to freeways for quick access to anywhere in the Norfolk and Virginia Beach area.	5.0
The service was amazing! From the check-in to check-out, and everything in between, we were pampered and given the best service possible. When you check-in you have the option to order tea/coffee and newspaper delivery to your room each morning. This option arrives early each morning and is an amazing service from this hotel. Room service was delicious and the... More	5.0
I pulled into Motel Parking Lot that was empty except for homeless guy with his shopping cart. Motel Sign light blinking as if burning out. Broken bed frame tossed away at side of building. Didn't even get out of car, went to Hotel next door. when calling to cancel, was met with questions as to why, owner not very understanding.	1.0
This hotel is wonderful. It is away from the hustle and bustle, but is situated nicely. The mall and other restaurants are very close. We even took a 2 hour excursion to St. George Island. We had a ball! Can't wait to go back.	5.0
Nice room but horrible Internet. The breakfast was good as was the happy hour.	5.0
I chose the hotel for the indoor pool. The indoor pool was closed. I got a non-smoking room. The room smelled of smoke, as did my clothes, later.	3.0
Very friendly staff...accomdating and hospitable. Room was decent, but hotel does allow pets and we had 3 yipping dogs across the hall. They did not disturb our sleep, however they barked whenever they heard us going in and out of the room or talking loud in our room.	4.0
Only thing nice about the property was the friendly staff, room layout and decent location. The property has nothing else to offer!	2.0
When we came for a visit for a friend's wedding, we chose this hotel based on its price an amenities for our group of 5. Our suite with its two beds and sofa bed was roomy and had everything we needed for a good stay. The front room was rather dark, without windows, but was comfortable. The bathroom was nice... More	5.0
This hotel is like living in a construct zone. The hallways are not air cond and missing the baseboards. The room had chips in every wall. The bath tub has millldew stains around the edge. Hotel doors are not lock and in fact some could not be locked because the operating bar was missing. When I told them about the unsecured doors, the reply was that they had cameras. Breakfast was a joke - kids cerials, mini bagels and cupcakes with terrible coffee. Our flight was delayed a day and we checked out and used another hotel. Best description is it is run on the cheap. Shame on Ramada.	1.0
If you want a relaxing vacation this is NOT for you. We came for a relaxing five days with our family for our anniversary. They didn't even congratulate us or do anything special for the room. Staff is rude and unprofessional and this place lacks big time on service. The pool is pretty but packed with drunk people and different... More	1.0
Great stay, quiet, and affordable. West Texas is famous for its hospitality and this place contributes mightily to that reputation. I especially liked the outdoor fire pit and sitting areas. I look forward to coming back.	5.0
I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. It does show its age, but was a very comfortable stay non the less. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The pool was a hit with the kids and it was great that they had an on duty life guard. Continental breakfast was more than your typical free breakfast with hot food.	5.0
I've stayed at the Comfort Inn for several years while attending the RVIA Expo. For the first few years it was an older version of what it is now. The rooms have been renovated, the carpet is clean and the beds are great! I'm picky about beds and these are better than some of much higher priced hotels I've stayed... More	4.0
Nice check in and out fast. The pool area, like the frosted glass but if more than three double rooms go to the pool it exceeds its capacity. I never like this in new hotel due size but that's part the flag standards. The hallways smell like nasty feet, no so much the rooms. Breakfast was to standards and knowing... More	5.0
We stayed for one night. We were very tired. Check in and check out was a breeze. Very friendly staff, clean rooms and even though it was next to a truck stop, didn't hear any noise all night. Would stay here again.	4.0
I try to be fair and objective in my TripAdvisor reviews, because I take others' reviews seriously when booking a hotel. Unfortunately, the Wyndham Garden Elk Grove Village has been one of the worst examples of bad customer service I have ever encountered. The hotel's bad customer service, and even worse shuttle service left our party out an extra 70,... More	1.0
This place was horrible! They are being completely remodeled so there hasn't been any general maintanance for awhile you can tell. Also, none of the staff we encountered should even be working in the hotel/service industry, no clue about their job. No pool, only a couple floors even have rentable rooms, poor selection for breakfast, all starchy items not even any fruit, and no internet in the so called business center! They could at least have put a sign on the door. We were going to do our air check-in one morning and couldn't, if we had known the night before we could have planned something else. Really awful. We had several other family members there as well. Hotels.com shouldn't even have them on their list. The photos do not portray what it is now. Bottom line-DO NOT STAY HERE!	1.0
Bad: The music in the lobby was horrendous. House music that made me want to die or run away with my hands over my ears. Totally cruel to make the hotel receptionists listen to that all day long and it made the lobby an undesirable place to spend time. They should be playing jazz or something easy on the ears. Good: Location and room/decor, amenities	4.0
We stayed here for a week just after Christmas with a family of 5. We booked two inter-connecting rooms, both had a king and a queen which was very comfortable for 5 people. We didn't book an ocean view room and overlooked the garden, in the Shipwreck Wing near the tennis courts - the outlook was fine. We booked this... More	5.0
Second time for us in this hotel, and as before very nice place. Location is excellent to visit the Napa valley area. Centrally located to visit the wineries and near the downtown area. Staff is very nice and helpful. Accomodations very good. We had an issue the second night where we requested a change of room because we had a very noisy and rowdy family in the room above us. The type of inconsiderate people existent in todays society. It is not the hotels fault. Vincent, in the front desk, was very helpful in getting us another room in the 3rd floor.It pleases us to know you had a good time while visiting our hotel, thank you very much for taking the time to share your review. You are welcome back anytime!Hilton Garden Inn Napa Management	4.0
We/I have been staying at the Baymont several times month for a week at a time since 2013 The front desk staff are ALWAYS friendly and helpful, my room is clean and stocked. If there are ever any problems, they are addressed immediately. It makes me feel like Im an owner, not just passing through. Thanks!	5.0
The hotel was obviously last decorated in the 1980s. It is definately NOT A RESORT! The work-out center was dirty. The pool was much smaller than the 1980s brochures depicted. The brochure shows someone sitting on the island. There is a sign indicating that you must stay off of the island. There is a young girl in a raft in the swimming pool on the brochure also. That is laughable! A female bartender (description: Caucasian w/ longer brown hair-sorry, all I've got) was EXTREMELY RUDE during EVERY INTERACTION! The comforter had a blood stain on the side that sat on the pillows. The outside of the balcony door was completely rusted. The room door was paper- thin. We heard every normal volume conversation that went on outside of the room including the ones that occurred at 3 a.m. Truly, we were awakened several times during each night, just by conversations occuring in the hallway. The noise level was by far, the worst part of the stay. We got very little sleep.	1.0
No need to infuse the air with that small/fragrance. Your other guests may like it, but I prefer natural air and so held my breath between the front door and the elevator.The room keepers can also be more gentle with closing the doors during their morning rounds, so as not to wake other rooms' occupants.Other than the above points, a good place to stay near French quarter.Truly thankful you enjoyed your stay and while we love the fresh air ourselves, that signature scent can be found around the world at all Aloft hotels. We appreciate the feedback regarding our housekeeping staff and will be sure to share with the department leader to help rectify that problem.Thank you again for your business and hope you'll be back soon,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager	5.0
My husband and I recently stayed at the Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines on our trip to Napa. As soon as we arrived we were greeted by a very helpful front desk clerk who made sure we had everything we needed. The rooms we clean and very nice. Overall I'd give this hotel a 100 and I'd definitely come again!Ronda S,We are so glad you enjoyed your stay with us. Come back soon !	5.0

Good: Fantastic location right near Copley Square and directly above marathon finish line.	5.0
The bed was comfortable. The room had a bad musty smell. Was not cleaned well. Happy that I only had to stay one night.	2.0
Bad: The pool area was really disappointing. Very small and the service wasn't great. The bathroom in the room needed an upgrade. Needed a re-grouting in the shower, the sink had a huge crack in it and the sink made this weird gurgling noise when anyone above or below us turned on a tap. Good: The bed was comfortable.	3.0
This was my first stay at a Home2, and I was very pleased. The staff was excellent, the hotel clean and well-appointed, and breakfast was good and plentiful. The fitness center has sufficient equipment, but at least one machine did not work right and was not taken out of service/repaired during my week-long stay.	5.0
Bad: Breakfast is exactly the same every day and if you spend there 3 or more days you need a little wider choice. Good: The hotel has an excellent location, and is in walking distance from the beach. The staff is kind, the room is fine and clean, the coffee is good, considering the prices this is a good choice. You can find nice restaurants nearby, shops and bars too.	5.0
very nice stay.. will be back to another location	5.0
This hotel is the place to be to experience downtown Seattle. The Monorail, Seattle Center, are across the street and the waterfront is walkable or by shuttle.

The Benson is a beautiful old hotel within walking distance to many things downtown. The staff was very professional and welcoming.

clean room but not a good one...over the mechanical room and noisy.....broken shower head bracket which fell on my wife's foot....impossible to get breakfast in the morning with long line up and no food...no front desk support to solve problems	2.0
When I opened the door to my room the trash can was on the floor with garbage from it on the floor. There were big cigar or cigarette ashes on one bed and an aluminum beer can on the entertainment center. The room smelled like cigarette smoke. I called down to the front desk and she apologized emphatically and I went down to get another room key. Mind you I was with my family of 4, 2 small kids in tow. The second room was appeared clean however it still smelled like cigarette smoke. The only good thing about this hotel was the beds were comfy and the hot water lasted long enough for my family of four to take showers. continental breakfast was alright, but it was complimentary so, I cant complain. We stayed a total of 6 nights, but only because I had already prepaid. If I had not, we would have moved to another hotel.	3.0
Bad: I expected to have a much larger room that looks more like a suite.	4.0
The bed was very comfy and the breakfast was good plus the location was good close to stores and resturaunts. Loved the Jacuzzi tub very relaxing. The vending didn't provide water but stores were in walking distance plenty of towels and wash cloths provided just wish I could of got the room at a less price but overall very satisfied.	4.0
This thing doesnt have to be called a hotel, this is the worst place ever!!!!!!!!Hygiene is something the hotel doesnt know exsists, you can see food, cigarettes, used condoms and much more just a feet outside your door.Nasty parties during night!!

Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines is located perfectly in Napa Valley. Short distance to shops, downtown nightlife, and my favorite winery. They offered breakfast at Denny's which is a short walk from the hotel. The hotel landscape is eye catching, sort of romantic every time you drive into the parking lot. The amenities they offer are very nice, excellent fitness room, wiifi, and pool area.traveler2016now - Wow, thank you for taking the time to write such a glowing review, it sounds like you had a memorable visit to Napa and this makes me smile! We hope to offer you a stellar time next time you are in town.	5.0
I booked this room for one of my drivers and am appalled at what she reported back to me. The first room had a broken tv that wasn't even connected to the electric/cable. So as not to be blamed for the damage she requested a new room. She was given keys to another room and as she entered the room, somebody was already sleeping in it!! She apologized and went back to the front desk to request a 3rd room. She refused to go to the room without the agent going first to make sure everything was ok with it. The agent complied and came back and issued her the key. Everything seemed ok till she went in the restroom and found the toilet full of what should have flushed away! She called the front desk and reported it but nothing was done about it. This is no way to run a railroad and I won't put any of my drivers there again!!	1.0
Everything about this hotel was wonderful. The room was spacious and well-appointed, the staff was friendly and the food was great. We enjoyed our dinner so much the first night we had dinner again at the hotel the second night. Will definitely stay here again.	5.0
This is a great place to stay to sleep. Thats what I was looking for. Staff is friendly. Rooms are clean. Older hotel but updated. Can be loud as this is a motel. I felt very safe. Parking is easy. Good value for the money.	4.0

The room was very clean, large room and had a nice decor. It was centrally located to various wineries, outlett, restaurants and downtown area.

We are glad you enjoyed your stay and will see you on your next visit.	5.0
The hotel was clean but the service personnel leave much to be desired. They were not as helpful as you would expect. They could anser simple questions and some even had attitudes.	3.0
My first night, my room was ok, but the AC fan or housing made a racket. I actually removed the plastic covering because it was broken and I thought that's what was rattling...wrong. I probably should have requested a new room, but by then I had my toiletries unpacked and didn't feel like moving. I was tired, so I slept through the noise, no problem. My second night I asked for a different room - the AC was still noisy, must just be 'normal'. The halls smelled a little musty, but the shining light of the stay was the front desk and housekeeping personnel. I had forgotten an expensive temperpedic pillow in my first room that I take with me when I travel. I didn't notice that I didn't have it until I was ready to go to bed the 2nd night (in a different room). The front desk people were very attentive, but housekeeping had gone home for the night or something and the front desk didn't have the key to their storage room....SO, I had to wait until I checked out the next morning to get me pillow back. But I DID get my beloved pillow back, so, all's well that ends well.	3.0
The room was a lot nicer than I expected. The hotel staff at the front desk was amazing. Very helpful. Clean good smelling rooms. Pretty pool.

We stayed here for 3 nights in the Birch Lodge at the far end of Church Landing. The accommodations were impeccable albeit a bit dark.

The purpose of my trip was to attend the wedding and reception of a friend's daughter. I was only driving up for this, and was not concerned about luxury and amenities. From the pictures, etc., that I viewed on-line, it looked like a good place for a brief stay. However, the whole hotel is in great need of maintenance work. The metal walkway and steps outside the rooms were rusty. The bathtub was old, caulking needed, mildew stains on a plastic towel holder. There were water spots on the sink handle when we arrived. Towels and washcloths provided were threadbare. Cigarette butts littered the parking lot and the metal walkway and steps. The advertised continental breakfast was definitely bare bones--bread, bagels, and waffles to pop in a toaster, cold cereal and milk, muffins, coffee, tea, and orange juice available. No yogurt or fresh fruit. Had I not prepaid for the room, I would not have stayed. My friend and I decided to wait to shower or bathe until we'd done the four-hour drive home.	1.0

My extended weekend stay at this hotel was very enjoyable. I have no complaints. I would strongly advise, though, that guests make use of the shuttle service to and from the subway station.

The Hotel itself is nice and fairly clean. However, booked the hotel months ago and when we arrived, which was late and after 12am, we were told that our twin room was not available, they had sold it, and we could have a double room with 1 bed. They were going to put up a portable bed, but took them a while to find it. We were offered to go to other hotel, but they were fully booked too. The hotel changed the room the following night, but no compensation, apart from a free drink which we had to fight for as well, were offered.	2.0
Reason for stay was to catch flight early am. Location is excellent to airport. Shuttle service efficient, although was somewhat crowded leaving. Return was very good. Also, hotel is close to restaurant I love to visit. Overall very good experience!	4.0

We got some needed clothes shopping done and then had dinner and drinks at El Gaucho. What a wonderful hotel and connected restaurant experience. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys first class service and wonderful food.	5.0
There weren't enough towels and washcloths placed in the room before our arrival. When I asked for two more, they only had one washcloth the other washcloths and towels had yet to be washed. They didn't have food available for the Grab Go Breakfast initially, but the manager pulled something together eventually. The staff is very nice, however, and the hotel is very convenient to dining, shopping, and touring.	1.0
This is one of the best hotels we have stayed in. It's very close to the Atlanta airport, which is convenient, although we did hear the planes off and on. It has a small Starbucks inside the lobby, and fresh salads and wraps for purchase anytime also.	5.0
We were looking for a Saturday night stay. Most hotels require a 2-night minimum. Inn at the Vines would book a one night for a Queen bed, which was fine with us. AAA discount was 186. If you have a BW member then you get a free breakfast at Denny's which is next door. Hotel was refurbished about 1-year ago, so everything was clean and fresh. Only issue is the in-wall air conditioning units are too loud to run while sleeping.Great location and convenient to freeways.Thank you for your review! I am sorry about the noisey a/c unit and will have it checked out. Almost all units have been replaced and maybe we missed one somehow. Your sleep and comfort is our main goal and with a little fun on the side. Come back and let us show why we are BEST WESTERN!	4.0
Outstanding location. Hotel is beautiful and well-kept. Staff very friendly and helpful. Great food. The pool and pool bar are rooftop and offer a panoramic view of the city and river. Very relaxing. Also very relaxing is having a drink and enjoying the pianist in the afternoon. I enjoy the breakfast brunch.	4.0
we requested a non-smoking room and our assigned only room available reeked of cigarette smoke. The bathroom had mold around the tub, and the carpeted floor were dirty.	4.0
Bad: The restaurant was closed for a refurb and as a result we had to eat our breakfast in the lobby on our knees. We had tiny plastic plates and plastic cutlery and a poor food choice . I was not informed by booking.com that this was the case . It was not the service we wanted for 675 dollars for 2 nights!!. Good: The room was good	2.0
Bad: There's nothing not to like here. Though the maid service was good but they are kind of early to knock at the door for cleaning service. They're there at 8am and we were still in dreamland that we were forced to get up and open the door to talk to them to clean later. Good: We love our very spacious room though we didn't have a single king sized bed. They gave us twin beds but it's fine. The Garden court buffet was also great! It was very affordable. We almost eat there everyday because of its price. Please keep it that way.	5.0
Good: My wife and I stayed at the charlesmark for 4 days. The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating. Room was a little small, but very clean and modern.	5.0

We stayed here for a car show with our 5 year old grandson. The only complaint that I have the ice machine on our floor didn't work. The staff were all great. All the beds are sleep number beds. The wifi works.	4.0
We stayed two nights here. The plus side: Clean room and bathroom Name brand cereals, yogurt, etc. at breakfast plus fresh fruit Great wifi Negatives: Dirty hallways Worst coffee EVER However, we would go back there if we return to Palo Duro! I would take my own coffee!	4.0
Bad: Wish there was ironing and ironing board in room. As well as microwave. They did provide iron and ironing board that I shared with my girlfriend 2 doors down and they let me use their microwave by the bar. So worked out. Good: Loved Javier and rest of the staff. Anything I needed they accommodated.	5.0
Had issues with checkin in everyone was backed up there is two seperate hotels across a busy street from one another . Tbe hotel is in the hood . Key didnt work clean up lady was more help than the front desk staff. Get a name brand hotel maybe a few minutes further away from downtown than this place.	1.0
Nice hotel, although on the older side. Reception staff couldn't be friendlier. Breakfast was supplied but a little limited in selection. Hotel within easy reach of the beach, shopping and bus routes and the activity coordinator at reception was very useful Room had a kitchenette with fridge which was a definite plus although benches and cupboards much higher than standard...

The rooms are hard to get to, only One elevator and a lot of Stairs. We had a lot of stuff and it was challenging. Also to pay for parking was ridiculous!	3.0
This Hotel was clean and well kept.. However because I have children they put me on the Same floor as other children. I was woken up many times throughout the night by screaming children and they were not my own!It was very loud throughout the night of people talking and running up and down the hallways! I was quite disturbed by this. Overall the room was comfortable just very loud and obnoxious people that happened to stay there which is unfortunate.	3.0
We were in the best western premier on Feb. 11 with our two Yorkshire terrorists. The staff were so very nice. The hotel is very clean rooms were spacious.The resteraunts connected to the hotel is very nice.Good food at reasonable prices.The breakfast buffet is all you could ask for. We will definitely return to this find hotel.	5.0
We had stayed at this Days Inn several years ago, and it has gone down hill since then. The breakfast was minimal, and the equipment in the fitness room did not work. The sink in the room was outside the bathroom, which was inconvenient. The room was clean, however, as was the corridor and hallway. The location is good with... More	2.0
The hotel location is good, the employees very nice and polite, although my room was in the middle there was no noise. My only disappoinment was the parking lot, not too many at front.	4.0
The absolute BEST location for a downtown Seattle hotel just steps from the Space Needle, EMP Museum, Pacific Science Centre, etc.. Fully equipped kitchen in the suite and LOTS of space -- larger than most one-bedroom apartments! Excellent buffet breakfast setup with top-notch food quality and very comfortable seating with views of the Space Needle, etc. The rooftop deck has lots of comfortable seating and fire pits etc,, so a wonderful place to wind down and end your day. Too bad the parking stalls are extremely tight limited however, it's to be expected for such a prime downtown location. We will be back for sure!877tiffanyl,We are thrilled to hear the Hyatt House met your needs and appreciate the positive feedback. Im glad you were able to take advantage of the kitchen facilities in the room, complimentary breakfast spread in the morning and rooftop terrace. Its wonderful to know when guests have a comfortable stay as we are grateful of the comments. We look forward to your next visit in Seattle!Sarah Junge	5.0
The only downside to this hotel is the service that came with the breakfast buffet. She was rude, abrupt and confrontational when asked any questions. Beyond that I would have easily given this hotel a perfect 5 star rating. It is quiet, beds are so comfortable, front desk is amazing! The location is walking distance to really great food and...

Stayed with many family members attending a family reunion in 6 different rooms. Most room numbers began with 1 so an incorrect assumption was that the rooms were on the first floor. The hotel seems to be on a slight rise and has different levels for the same floor. Our rooms on the same floor were either accessed via entrance 2, which required some stairs or entrance 3 which required no stairs. Note that there is no elevator. Some issues with a couple of rooms, but hotel staff was quick to rectify. My room included a refrigerator and a microwave. Breakfast in the conference room below had make your own waffles, hard-boiled eggs, toast and muffins, and oatmeal - coffee, tea, and juice.	4.0
This hotel is definitely worth the price. Large nicely decorated room, large bathroom with walk-in shower, lots of nice touches to make you feel pampered. The beds are awesomely comfy pillowtops with 2 fluffy down comforters per bed. Location was about a ten minute walk from the space needle. Offstreet secure covered parking. We will definitely stay here next time... More	5.0
The staff was courteous and attentive to us The room was nice, had a privacy wall and was big enough for a family of four.	5.0
Location, Location, Location.... yes. But facility definately showing aging. Parking should be included in the cost of stay. It is kind of like saying rooms are $/ night, but you have to pay to use the toilet. But with that said location could not be better.	3.0
Overall, this was a nice hotel in a convenient location. The room was clean and comfortable. It is a little expensive considering parking, Wifi, and breakfast aren't even included. We didn't have time to check out any of the restaurants or amenities. We enjoyed our stay.	4.0

Advertised as a golf resort, but the golf course has been closed for well over a year. One small swimming pool was open, the large lap pool and fitness center are closed :( Not updated in a long time, it's 4 unit 2 story bungalows for much of the property. Quiet, easy access to San Diego which is a 20+ minute drive.	3.0
We had a minor issue with our toilet, the staff was very attentive to our issue and worked to resolve our problem timely. We appreciated their responsiveness.	5.0

Super 8 has come a long way in recent years. This one looks great from exterior, has friendly staff - something I have notice across the country in past couple of years.

Highly recommended...	5.0
My visit was like my previous ones. Fantastic. I was welcomed at the front desk by Carolyn. But it didn't end there. All of the Hotels employees I encountered were equally welcoming.

Union organizers with megaphone reading union laws at 7 am! Due to the layout of the hotel it is amplified tenfold. Apparently there are no noise violations for doing this. Won't be back to Santa Monica better places to go that have better ordinances. Police just drive by like there is nothing going on.	1.0
It was terrible i will never stay there again. Dirty, noisy, tv didnt work. The staff was a joke	1.0

We stayed here in July for half of our Maui stay. We have been to Maui several times and this was our favorite place we've stayed so far.

My family travelled to Anaheim for the winter break 2014.

Stayed one night at this Best Western for a half marathon the next morning. Overall, hotel gave the impression of being slightly dingy and outdated and was the type of hotel where all the rooms are accessed from an outdoor hallway. The service was friendly and helpful and the room was relatively clean and comfortable enough. Some stains on the carpet at the door though. Did not eat the breakast since we were up early for the race but I saw at check in that the dining room spilled out into the lobby which I thought was a little crowded looking to say the least. Great location as it was close to the plethora of wineries nearby and also close to several shopping and dining areas. Close to major highways without being noisy too. Next time I'd search for a slightly nicer hotel but this visit was satisfying for our needs.	3.0
My wife had a birthday party at theHoliday Inn North Phoenix.The event we had was wonderfully planned by Phil McIlveen,the hotel's director of sales.He helped in planning a great party within our budget.Phil went above and beyond his limits to ensure that the event was successful.The staff were courteous and very ready to listen and help out wherever and whenever we needed them.We will surely have more events in the future at this location and we will send referrals to Phil.Thank you for the hospitality.George	5.0
We came to the hotel and weree so.overwhelmed with the smell of bleach that our eyes and throats burned. The carpet was damp with the stuff and we couldn't even open the windows to open it up. There were hairs all over the bathroom and there was trash under the beds.	2.0

The Chalet is a great place to stay when visiting Mooshead Lake. Huge property with lots of space to relax and enjoy the outdoors and the lake. They let guests use canoes, kayaks and paddleboats. Tghis is also a pet friendly motel. The owners are visible, helpful and friendly. Walking distance to the village area and a great value.	5.0
The lobby was nice, but the room was small and the bathroom was dirty. The room didn't have a small refrigerator which I was shocked to find. So much for my leftovers. The woman when we checked in and out was standoffish. Good things about the hotel: the bed was comfortable and the location was nice. After arriving home I discovered a charge on my card from the hotel. I didn't do anything to incur a charge so I called them to ask about it. The woman on the phone was unbelievably rude! She transferred me to a voicemail where one of my options was to press zero for personal assistance (which is why I called). I was rerouted to the same woman who now seemed incredibly frustrated by me and insisted I leave a voicemail. She transfers me again. I just thought she could have been more polite and accommodating. I did get the issue sorted out, but the attitude of the woman on my initial phone call left a bad taste in my mouth. The location of this hotel is great, but the hotel itself isn't nice enough for the rate and the staff could use a lesson in manners and service.	2.0
I liked the big, clean room. The deep tub was a plus. Friendly staff, check in was fast. The bed was comfortable. There were plenty of pillows and towels. The room was quiet even though there were people in the nearby rooms.	5.0
Wonderful location and view. Food and services are excellent. Convenient to other areas of Kauai. We drove to many other areas of the island and found it very easy to get around. Any time we asked for information at the hotel they were very willing to help.	5.0

Very clean modern hotel with well appointed rooms. The front desk clerk Andrea was very helpful extremely polite. Electronic check in very easy to use saves a load of time. Would stay at this hotel again.	4.0
Very disappointed in my visit! There was no iron or ironing board so I went wrinkled. They false advertised free breakfast in morning because they just switched from Days inn to home stay so they didn't have license to serve food yet. I will not be back	2.0
great location right off of duval street. our room however was extremely small, smaller than a cruise ship, but very nice all the same. staff was friendly, breakfast was enough to get you going. pool area was beautiful. the only problem we had was that our room keys did not work properly. got one of them fixed which was good because after 11:00 at night no one is at the front desk to let you in lobby or hotel, a key is needed so double check you keys to outside entrances. would definitely return.As you found out, there is not a lot of space in Key West and yes some of the rooms are cozy. We appreciate the review and look forward to your return.	4.0

I thought the staff were very friendly, with an exception to one of the female pool staff. Perfect place for the kids though. We had an incident were our youngest got sick in the car, the front desk went out of their way to help, and within minutes helped me make an appointment for cleaning. They also recommended touring, although the touring company turned out to be a disaster! The downed elevator was a bit annoying. We read in a review that there was a cockroach in one of the rooms, and it was too bad that we also saw a quarter sized one in the breakfast area! We quickly told the kids it was a beetle. When I told the front desk about it, they were very apologetic and credited our parking.	4.0
Love this out of the way place. Comfortable bed. Clean room. Clean bathroom. Neat old wood floors that creak when you walk. The only downfall for some may be no WIFI in the room. You can go to a common area and tap in. Lovely quiet place. Office folk very nice.	4.0
Our room was nice, clean and comfortable. We have stayed here previously and can tell they have done a few updates. All the front desk personnel were helpful and friendly. The breakfast area is a bit disorganized and cramped. Food was OK, but nothing exciting. The hotel is well located and convenient to get downtown or anywhere else. We had... More	4.0
Bad: On one day our room did not cleaned until after 6.15 pm despite several messages. The front desk response was that the hotel was busy and it was not unheard of for rooms not be done at 6pm - and offered an apology as did housekeeping. We were more than a little surprised to hear this...most hotels are busy mid summer. We have experinced delays but nothing like this. We had to reschedule dinner appointment. As we were only there for 2 nights it was rather disappointing. Good: Location and facilities.	4.0
We wanted a quiet get away. We had a great time. The hot tub was fabulous. Free breakfast in the morning many choices, great tasting food. We will definately be here again. Also Ho-Chunk had a shuttle bus. Wow!	5.0

My daughter and I have stayed for 5 nights here during our visit to New Orleans. Very cute hotel, modern design, good vibe, friendly staff! We've got a nice corner room at 14th floor, beds were so comfortable and everything is new and clean! Walking distance from French quarter, Bourbon street, Lafayette square, we didn't even use any transportation beside the street car to get to the City Park.

I like staying at Best Westerns because I can count on a clean room and the right accommodations. The reason I give this one four instead of five circles is because the room looked like it needed a little maintenance. But it was clean. They have a free breakfast included with your stay from 6 am to 10 am.	4.0
Nice large rooms, but our A/C did not work well, especially in the bedroom. This was a higher priced King Corner Suite. Only stayed for 1 night, so told front desk staff on the way out. Happy hour is a nice idea, but no way to get near the small and understaffed bar to get a drink. Could not check in at 1:00, had to wait until 3 pm, which is the rule, but would have been nice to find a room earlier. Breakfast was very good.	3.0
Nice hotel, staff were the best I have interacted with in years. Accommodations were very clean.	5.0
I was not familiar with DC. After arriving and using the Metro, the police officers and others told me I was not staying in the safest part of DC.

Very helpful and friendly staff, who upgraded the room, even though they could not see from their notes that it should accomodate 5 persons. They also gave very good advice regarding restaurants and nearby attractions like Six Flags in LA county. The beds were very comfortable and clean. The breakfast room was also very tidy and had plenty of space. There as also a nice pool there (which we did not make use of). Very good value for money. It also had a convenient location for us, close to Camarillo's attractions as well as other places within driving distance, like for example LA, Santa Barbara, Malibu and Solvang. The business room was also very useful, and things were in order.	5.0
Generally the room was nice. However, the a/c unit in the room did not cool adequately and the iron sprayed/steamed rusty water. I would stay at the facility again. The staff was very pleasant and the facility is convenient to the interstate.	4.0

I spent two nights at the Metro Points Hotel. The Hotel Guests was somewhat in some of term is seemed to be helpful. The reasons I took points off because Breakfast Foods were awful. The chef used pre-packages on most of the buffet foods. The hospitality of the service was very negative. 10 charged for using microwaves is ridiculous! There is no another way to heating up my foods from take-out place. Not the best family hotel to book it. Probably more for last minute business trip. .	2.0
We had the most amazing stay! Not being from the area we didn't no much about the places around us so upon asking the front desk staff (Vanessa) we where given directions to everything we could need.

This hotel needed to be renovated 5 years ago. It is very tired and kept poorly. Mildew in corners of tub, poor bath amenties and so so cleaning of rooms. The high speed internet that they charge you 9.95 for is a total joke - super slow and almost unusable. As a business traveler, I would never stay here again.	2.0
Staff was rude, hotel is dirty, no hot water, questionable neighborhood. Was one of the worst hotels I have visited. The low rate is not low enough. Would not recommend under any circumstance. Pay the extra fifty dollars a night and stay at the Courtyard.	1.0

We arrived by chance at the St.Regis after the Waldorf failed to provide us with an updated room. The St. Regis was very beautifully appointed and the front desk staff was very accommodating as well. We needed a larger room as we were having guests joins us for dessert and drinks and although there was an additional charge 1,000 more for the room, it was just what we needed and really pretty. The room however, was with out a view, or rather with a view of other building walls, so in the morning it was a bit dreary and dark. If you book a room at the St. Regis, make sure to ask for a high floor or you will be in darkness, despite the wonderful dcor and amenities.Dear Dirwpgops, Thank you for taking the time to detail your recent stay with us. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your larger room but are dissapointed that you were not pleased with the view. Should you ever encounter this again, kindly contact our Front Desk team to see if we have alternative options for you. Thank you again and we hope to see you again soon.With warm regards,Pedro RodriguezDirector of Front Office	4.0

This was an unexpected surprise! We usually stay on Canal or with friends but this will change that in the future. Loved the hardwood floors and quaint atmosphere. There were no kids running around and it is less than 10 minute walk to Bourbon Street. Continental breakfast, coffee ALL DAY, and really good cafes nearby, open 24 hours or at least late night. Parking lot is secured at night, cameras monitoring as well. Also right across from trolley stop (so convenient-did not have to move the car)!! Wi-fi included	5.0
Cheap rate for a clean room with comfortable bed. Refrigerator in room for no extra charge. COLD AC. Easy walking distance to a couple convenience stores, fast food, and a local restaurant. Would definitely stay again.	5.0
When booking in this area we looked at both Sonoma and Napa. Sonoma is generally more expensive so we picked Napa, they are very close. We were glad that we picked Napa, it is a pretty and very manageable town and this hotel was very good. I thought that it might be a bit far out but it is not. Napa is very small and it is only a few minutes to drive to the central area where there are lots of great restaurants and shops. My husband walked it in the mornings. There are much pricier hotels than this one further out from the town centre.The room that we had was freshly reno'd and was large, clean and had a comfortable bed with nice linens. The only thing that we found a bit strange is what they call a balcony... it is an enclosure with a hole cut in it. We had a room looking out over the pool, but you can't see anything sitting on the balcony.The staff were very helpful and gave us great advice and suggestions each morning before we set out. The breakfast is at Denny's so you can get a big breakfast or get a something smaller and take the 5 credit.The pool and hot tub were small but nice at the end of the day. Would recommend this hotel.We are glad you had a Great Stay. Come back and stay with us on your next visit to Napa.	4.0
Bad: The bathroom is very small, smaller than I am used to. The saimin noodle soup at the cafe was terrible, the noodles were mushy and blend. Good: Location was right. The buffet was so so. The food at the cafe was okay. The rooms are kind of small but okay.	3.0
The hotel looks very high class without breaking the budget. Staff are very friendly and have kind attitudes towards guests. They are very accommodating and are a pleasure to be around.

This was our second stay at the St. Regis, and this time we booked through American Express Platinum concierge. As part of their fine hotel's program, we booked for 2 days and the third night was comped. It also included 100.00 towards meals and complete breakfast for 2. Upon checking in, Hugo acknowledged me as a Platinum SPG guest and upgraded us to the Madison Suite! Every room comes with a butler, who will bring you complimentary tea or coffee service. There's a house Bentley which is available on a first come,first served basis. The food is extremely good in their restaurant and the King Cole bar is internationally famous.Dear 112traveler47, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

When I got to the hotel and explained it to the front desk supervisor, Empriss, she was very compassionate. She did everything in her power to make our shortened stay as comfortable as possible. All the staff were very friendly and I plan on returning as soon as possible to complete our trip. Our room was awesome. Very clean. The view was awesome. We plan on returning as soon as possible to complete our trip. Thanks Empriss for being so kind and caring.	5.0
I have stayed in this hotel 5 times. It has always been clean, the staff is friendly, it has been a great value. The breakfast has been good for my family.

I stayed here twice last summer and it was well worth it. There are plenty of stores and restaurants near by, and the beach is within walking distance.

Thanks to other TA reviews, I was happy to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn for 2 nights. It is right downtown and steps from everything.

Dreadful place to stay. Beyond belief that they can charge such an exorbitant rate for such inferior accommodation. We arrived late after an exhausting journey and just needed some sleep. Some hope.

This is by far the best Choice affiliated hotel in which we have stayed. Everything is clean and orderly and the staff was just great. The breakfast menu is better than most.

We were very disappointed in this hotel. The cable was out our entire stay, the pool was not filled (in july) and the bar/restaurant was closed. We wernt told about any of this. Was not worth the amount we paid. Very disappointed!	1.0
The hotel was nice but unfortunately something was wrong with our air. We turned it in at checkin around 6 and was hoping by bedtime it would be better. We just decided to suck it up so we could try to get some rest in hopes of waking up cooler	4.0
Hotel work in progress. Pretty enough and nice roof top bar. Tiny gym. Terrible WiFi and worse service and effort in dining room. Its not a great deal with these issues. If they care they can improve but not clear they do. Also my room was not clean until 6 on the day we checked in forcing us to wait 2 hours. Thank you for choosing NOPSI! We appreciate your feedback. I am disappointed to hear that service did not meet your expectations. If travels should bring you back, we would love the opportunity to demonstrate our service levels in the future.Warm Regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager	3.0

The hotel was very clean. It was in a nice, safe neighborhood. The staff was friendly and polite. The breakfasts were better than most hotels. I broke my leg on the ski slope and the assistant manager went OUT OF HIS WAY to help me!!!	5.0

Clean, nice staff and wonderful pool. Great location, but because of that it's pretty noisy. The decor was not my fave, but that's not a big deal.

The motel is being redone, so it was a little messy. My room was all new, and the mattress was wonderful! I have a bad back and knees but after the second night I walked out carrying my cane!

Service was terrible, could not get any one on the phone to ask questions, there was only one GSR in the lobby. the breakfast was cold, room was dirty, floor never vacuumed, only one bar of soap, only one set of towels of each size	1.0
Bad: The minibar and the heating were noisy, but it didn't really disrupt our sleep. Breakfast was good, but perhaps the avocado toast was a bit small for the price. Good: The staff were all friendly and professional. Our room was clean and warm (it was cold out!) and had everything we needed. The drinks and food were very good, especially the Finch burger and the crab bennies at breakfast. Overall, we really liked the feel of the hotel and would definitely stay again, especially if we were going out of North Station again which is just around the corner.	4.0
We stayed here to see a show at Pechanga. The casino was about 20 minutes away. The hotel was freeway close. Everyone at this hotel was super friendly. The rooms were clean and the breakfast very good and fresh. Unfortunately, I did not get to use the pool but it was clean as well.	5.0
The room was not bad, but the couch was so worn we practically sat on the floor. It was also pretty stained. The bedspread was also very worn and starting to get holes in it. The beds were kinda hard. It did have 2 full bathrooms and a full kitchen including dish washer!!! I felt safe and the room was easy to find. Map quest did put us at the back of the hotel though, and it was kind of confusing to get up to the front office. Overall it wasn't bad. It was clean. It just needs a few furniture updates.	3.0
Last minute late night Stay. Hampton Inn claimed no room reserved , yet had the conference room which was done at the same time!

I was highly disappointed this time around. This is my second time staying at this hotel and I did not like anything about our room. The 1st time we stayed here the room and price was great so we decided to stay again. We wanted a Jacuzzi and we were told in the room description that we would have one, but instead when we got to the room we had a regular jetted tub that did not work at all. We paid double for a room expecting something spectacular and we got nothing. The breakfast was okay, but it was so congested that you really could not enjoy your meal . Unfortunately, we will not be staying at this hotel again.	1.0
Bad: There is nothing I didn't like. Good: Very friendly staff and very clean.	5.0

Just as great a location and much better service and accomodations. Price was about the same.	2.0

Overall this is a great property. The lobby, restaurant, and hotel rooms are really well done. Lots of nice touches with great designs. Tons of character here. We stayed in a double queen room which we thought had plenty of space. The gym is located between two floors and has a Peloton bike and the hotel provides the shoes. As a cycling, I thought this was awesome. I already had a Peloton login. The music in the gym, however, was too loud and we called to have it turned down and the staff couldn't figure out how to do it. The staff were all friendly and courteous - bellhops, front desk staff and concierge all included. Location very convenient to a number of places downtown. Beds and pillows were comfortable. TVs changed channels without the annoying 1 second delay at most other hotels. There's some construction going on at the property next door to be aware of, but it's New York and good luck finding somewhere without construction. Definitely recommend.Dear chitripguy, Thank you very much for your detailed and wonderful review. I am so glad you enjoyed our property from our comfortable rooms and the gym. We pride ourselves in service and i'm very happy to read you've enjoyed your stay. Hopefully we get to welcome you back again in the future!Warmest Regards, Nick HaferGeneral Manager	5.0

There's a newer Ramada closer to the airport, but because Ramada appears to be all franchise, you never know what you're getting, and this was bad.

This hotel was newly renovated, which made me expect something better. The room smelled awful, and there were dead crickets on our bathroom floor. The decor had in the room had in fact been updated. The bathroom had old tiles old tub old toilet with a new vanity top and mirror. Everything else was obviously old. Our black out curtains were held together with paper clips, we could hear EVERYTHING going on in the room next to us, the hallway, and upstairs! When any doors would shut, our room would loudly vibrate. Our check in clerk was very nice and she tried to help us with anything we needed... Also, no elevator and my parents who are elder, were placed upstairs, making it hard to get them and their luggage to their room! This simply was an emergency place to sleep, but I clearly overpaid, because it was no better than Motel 6 (and it was double the price)	2.0

Elsah is charming. The inn is a very short walk from the river and a view of the bluffs. Our room was very comfortable and spacious.

Bad: The day shift wouldn't believe me that something was wrong with the room door lock and made me re-key. Then, they sent the cleaning staff to 'open my door for me' only to discover that the electronic key system won't work if the batteries in the lock haven't been replaced. Lastly, I never could figure out how to make the steam shower work, but after the episode with the door I decided it wasn't worth asking. Good: The night shift desk was helpful and once she realized she'd made a mistake, she went about solving the problem as quickly as she could. I was still locked out of my room for 30 to 45 minutes.	3.0
We stayed here in the heat of summer with our dog. While there isn't a huge dog area outside, walking down the business park street behind the hotel provided enough space for our dog to unwind from a long car ride. On leash.
